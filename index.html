                <h2>North Korea Exploited VPN Flaw to Hack South's Nuclear Research Institute #5</h2>
                <p>LSouth Korea's state-run Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) on Friday disclosed that its internal network was infiltrated by suspected attackers operating out of its northern counterpart.

                    The intrusion is said to have taken place on May 14 through a vulnerability in an unnamed virtual private network (VPN) vendor and involved a total of 13 IP addresses, one of which — "27.102.114[.]89" — has been previously linked to a state-sponsored threat actor dubbed Kimsuky.
                    
                    KAERI, established in 1959 and situated in the city of Daejeon, is a government-funded research institute that designs and develops nuclear technologies related to reactors, fuel rods, radiation fusion, and nuclear safety.
                    
                    Following the intrusion, the think tank said it took steps to block the attacker's IP addresses in question and applied necessary security patches to the vulnerable VPN solution. "Currently, the Atomic Energy Research Institute is investigating the subject of the hacking and the amount of damage," the entity said in a statement.
                    
                    The development comes following a report from SISA Journal, which disclosed the breach, alleging that the agency was attempting to cover up the hack by denying such an incident took place. KAERI attributed it to a "mistake in the response of the working-level staff." Active since 2012, Kimsuky (aka Velvet Chollima, Black Banshee, or Thallium) is a North Korean threat actor known for its cyber espionage campaigns targeting think tanks and nuclear power operators in South Korea.

                    Earlier this month, cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes disclosed a wave of attacks undertaken by the adversary to strike high-profile government officials in the country by installing an Android and Windows backdoor called AppleSeed for amassing valuable information.
                    
                    The targeted entities involved the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador of the Embassy of Sri Lanka to the State, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Nuclear Security Officer, and the Deputy Consul General at Korean Consulate General in Hong Kong, with the aforementioned IP address used for command-and-control (C2) communications.
                    
                    It is not immediately clear what VPN vulnerability was exploited to breach the network. But it's worth noting that unpatched VPN systems from Pulse Secure, SonicWall, Fortinet FortiOS, and Citrix have been subjected to attacks by multiple threat actors in recent years.</p>

                <h2>Cyber espionage by Chinese hackers in neighbouring nations is on the rise #4</h2>
                <p>A string of cyber espionage campaigns dating all the way back to 2014 and focused on gathering military intelligence from neighbouring countries have been linked to a Chinese military-intelligence apparatus.

                    In a wide-ranging report published by Massachusetts-headquartered Recorded Future this week, the cybersecurity firm's Insikt Group said it identified ties between a group it tracks as "RedFoxtrot" to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Unit 69010 operating out of Ürümqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the country.
                    
                    Previously called the Lanzhou Military Region's Second Technical Reconnaissance Bureau, Unit 69010 is a military cover for a Technical Reconnaissance Bureau (TRB) within China's Strategic Support Force (SSF) Network Systems Department (NSD). The connection to PLA Unit 69010 stems from what the researchers said were "lax operational security measures" adopted by an unnamed suspected RedFoxtrot threat actor, whose online persona disclosed the physical address of the reconnaissance bureau and has had a history of affiliating with the PLA's former Communications Command Academy in Wuhan.

                    RedFoxtrot is noted to target government, defense, and telecommunications sectors across Central Asia, India, and Pakistan, with intrusions in the last six months directed against three Indian aerospace and defense contractors as well as major telecommunications providers and government agencies in Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, and Pakistan.
                    
                    "Activity over this period showed a particular focus on Indian targets, which occurred at a time of heightened border tensions between India and the People's Republic of China," the researchers said.
                    
                    Attacks staged by the adversary involved an assortment of open- and closed-source tools that have been shared across Chinese cyber espionage groups, including PlugX, Royal Road RTF weaponizer, QUICKHEAL, PCShare, IceFog, and Poison Ivy RAT.
                    
                    Also observed is the use of AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE infrastructure, which encompasses a modular Windows backdoor called ShadowPad that has been previously attributed to APT41 and subsequently shared between other Chinese state-backed actors. Furthermore, domains registered by RedFoxtrot — "inbsnl.ddns[.]info" and "adtl.mywire[.]org" — suggest that the threat actor may have set its sights on Indian telecom service provider Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and a Bengaluru-based company called Alpha Design Technologies Limited (ADTL) that specializes in research and development of missile, radar, and satellite systems.

                    The development comes more than three months after another China-linked threat group, dubbed RedEcho, was uncovered targeting India's power grid, including a power plant run by National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Limited and New Delhi-based Power System Operation Corporation Limited.</p>

                <h2>Russia bans VyprVPN, Opera VPN services for not complying with blacklist request #3</h2>
                <p>Russia's telecommunications and media regulator Roskomnadzor (RKN) on Thursday introduced restrictions on the operation of VyprVPN and Opera VPN services in the country.

                    "In accordance with the regulation on responding to threats to circumvent restrictions on access to child pornography, suicidal, pro-narcotic and other prohibited content, restrictions on the use of VPN services VyprVPN and Opera VPN will be introduced from June 17, 2021," the state agency said in a statement.
                    
                    The watchdog described them as threats in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 127 dated February 12, adding the restrictions will not affect Russian companies using VPN services in continuous technological processes. The development comes a little over a month after RKN sent a request to enterprises and organizations that use the two VPN services to inform the Center for Monitoring and Management of the Public Telecommunications Network and seek exceptions so as to avoid disruptions to their business operations.

                    The agency said more than 200 technological processes associated with 130 Russian companies are included in the "white lists."
                    
                    On March 28, 2019, the Russian government required VPNs, anonymizers, and search engine operators to ensure that they block sites included on Roskomnadzor's regularly updated register of banned sites through the Federal State Information System (FSIS).
                    
                    To that effect, ten providers of virtual private network (VPN) servers — including NordVPN, Hide My Ass (HMA), Hola VPN, OpenVPN, VyprVPN, ExpressVPN, TorGuard, IPVanish, Kaspersky Secure Connection, and VPN Unlimited — were mandated to connect to the national blocklist.
                    
                    According to Russian news agency Interfax, Kaspersky Lab was the only company that complied with the request. Avast, another cybersecurity vendor, exited the VPN market following the order.</p>

                <h2>Fugitive Anonymous Hacker ‘Commander X’ Arrested #2</h2>
                <p>Fugitive hacker Christopher Doyon, or Commander X, was captured in Mexico and has been extradited to the United States, where he will face decade-old hacking charges. Doyon was a member of the Anonymous hacktivist collective. 

                    According to an indictment, Doyon was part of a series of coordinated cyber attacks following a protest in Santa Cruz, California in 2010. Demonstrators occupied the front steps of the Santa Cruz Courthouses for approximately two months, from July 4 to October 2, 2010,  to protest the county’s law against camping that directly impacted people experiencing homelessness in the city. 
                    
                    Doyon later allegedly shut down the Santa Cruz County website in a DDoS, or distributed denial of service attack, in a coordinated effort with the People’s Liberation Front and Anonymous. According to the indictment, they flooded the network with external communications requests so “the target could not respond to legitimate traffic, or responded so slowly as to render the target effectively unavailable.” “In retribution for Santa Cruz City’s enforcement of [the anti-camping law], the PLF coordinated and executed a DDoS attack against Santa Cruz County’s computer servers,” the indictment said. “The PLF referred to these co-ordinated attacks on Santa Cruz County as ‘Operation Peace Camp 2010.’”

                    He is also being charged for conspiracy to commit intentional damage to a protected computer, committing intentional damage to a protected computer, and aiding and abetting. The documents also named Joshua John Covelli, or “Absolem” or “Toxic,” as a co-conspirator.
                    
                    In addition to hacking charges, Doyon is also facing charges for failing to appear in court. At the time, his counsel reported that he had fled to Canada. He continued to hack for years, according to a book he published about hacking while a fugitive.
                    
                    Doyon was a fugitive in Mexico for nearly a decade after working with the PLF and later on was a high ranking member in the hacktivist group Anonymous during their most active years.
                    
                    Doyon has spoken extensively about his time as a fugitive and the charges he faces. “No servers were breached, no data was stolen. It’s a small, crowdsourced act of civil disobedience,” he said in 2017. “It’s unjust to take that many years away from me for protest … from my perspective, I’m in political exile. But according to the U.S. Department of Justice, I’m a fugitive.”

                    A crowdfunding campaign set up by friends of Doyon earlier this month calls him a “political refugee.”
                    
                    “We are a group of Mexican citizens and friends of Commander X, who support him in his exile,” the crowdfunding campaign states. “We know it is difficult times for all of us, but he’s a political refugee and needs us all right now. We’d love to give back a little of what he’s given us all. We’ve provided housing for him and his two beautiful dogs. A nice, safe place with fields and mountains. Now we have to deal with medical and that's where you come in.”  </p>

                <h2>Credit Card Hacking Forum Gets Hacked, Exposing 300,000 Hackers’ Accounts #1</h2>
                <p>Carding Mafia, a forum for stealing and trading credit cards has been hacked, exposing almost 300,000 user accounts, according to data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned.

                    The data breach allegedly exposed the email addresses, IP addresses, usernames, and hashed passwords of 297,744 users. Have I Been Pwned announced the data breach on Tuesday, saying the breach happened last week. 
                    
                    On the Carding Mafia forum and its public Telegram channel, however, there was no sign that its users have been warned. Carding Mafia has more than 500,000 users, according to the forum's own statistics. The site administrator did not immediately respond to an email asking for comment. 
                    
                    Troy Hunt, the founder of Have I Been Pwned, told Motherboard that he was able to confirm the hacked database is legitimate. Hunt said that he noticed in the database that there were Mailinator email addresses, a service that allows anyone to create throwaway email addresses. Hunt said that he then inserted those addresses in the forum, using the Forgot Password feature, and he saw that those emails are recognized as valid emails. Usually Mailinator email addresses are created for one purpose and are not reused; the fact that these addresses are contained in the data dump and are also recognized by the forum suggests that the data is legitimate. Motherboard can confirm that the forum says "you have not entered an email address that we recognize" when trying to use the Forgot Password feature with an email that we have not used to register on the forum. 

                    "Another 'hacker hacking hackers' story," Hunt said.  
                    
                    Motherboard has not seen the data, and we are unable to independently confirm the breach. 
                    
                    On another hacking forum, a user was advertising the data allegedly stolen from Carding Mafia on January 27 of this year. This is the latest example of forums that cater to hackers or cybercriminals getting hacked. In 2017, hackers stole the database of a hacking forum called Darkode right after it opened. The infamous OGUSERS forum, where people traded stolen Instagram and other social media accounts, has been hacked twice, in 2019, and 2020. More recently, security journalist Brian Krebs reported that three of the most important Russian-language cybercrime forums have been hacked over the span of three weeks. 

                    In all of these cases, the hacked user information can be used to link pseudonymous users across different forums. Law enforcement agencies could also use the stolen data to try to identify criminals hiding behind those nicknames.</p>
