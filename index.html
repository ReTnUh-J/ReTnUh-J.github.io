            <section>Critical Flaw Reported in Move Virtual Machine Powering the Aptos Blockchain Network #40</section>
            <h2>Researchers have disclosed details about a now-patched critical flaw in the Move virtual machine that powers the Aptos blockchain network.
                The vulnerability "can cause Aptos nodes to crash and cause denial of service," Singapore-based Numen Cyber Labs said in a technical write-up published earlier this month.
                Aptos is a new entrant to the blockchain space, which launched its mainnet on October 17, 2022. It has its roots in the Diem stablecoin payment system proposed by Meta (née Facebook), which also introduced a short-lived digital wallet called Novi.
                The network is built using a platform-agnostic programming language known as Move, a Rust-based system that's designed to implement and execute smart contracts in a secure runtime environment, also known as the Move Virtual Machine (aka MoveVM).
                The vulnerability identified by Numen Cyber Labs is rooted in the Move language's verification module ("stack_usage_verifier.rs"), a component that validates the bytecode instructions prior to its execution in MoveVM.
                Specifically, it relates to an integer overflow vulnerability in the stack-based Web3 programming language that could result in undefined behavior and therefore crashes.
                "Since this vulnerability occurs in the Move execution module, for nodes on the chain, if the bytecode code is executed, it will cause a [Denial-of-Service] attack," the cybersecurity firm explained.
                "In severe cases, the Aptos network can be completely stopped, which will cause incalculable damage, and have a serious impact on the stability of the node."

                <h2> Italian luxury car company Ferrari hacked #39</h2>
                <p>Italian carmaker Ferrari has been hacked, just four days after it hired cybersecurity firm Bitdefender.
                    The ransomware gang, RansomEXX, stated on its dark web blog that it had gained access to internal data, and had published more than 7 gigabytes of internal Ferrari documents.
                    It is an embarrassment for the luxury car brand that team boss Mattia Binotto and managing director of the Formula 1 team Scuderia Ferrari last week articulated the company's "security culture" and policy, as a partnership with Pete Defender, who has become the partner in cybersecurity, was announced. As part of the deal, the automaker will explore and evaluate BitDefender's cybersecurity products and services to integrate into its industry and business.
                    The ransomware group RansomEXX first came to attention in 2020 after its malware was used in a series of attacks on high-profile victims such as the Supreme Court of Justice in Brazil and the Department of Transportation in Texas.
                    The ransom group, also known as Defray777, is known for its brutality and intolerance even for charitable organizations. Among its victims are the Scottish Mental Health charity SAMH, which was hit with ransomware in March of this year, and personal information belonging to people working with the charity was leaked.
                    “We are so devastated by this attack, it is hard to understand why anyone would deliberately try to disrupt the work of an organization on which people in a vulnerable state depend,” said Billy Watson, chief executive of the Scottish Mental Health charity. </p>

                <h2> Babuk Ransomware is Back in Action #38</h2>
                <p>The Babuk ransomware gang appears to be back in action as it was found targeting and encrypting multiple corporate networks. The recent attack on the Metropolitan Police Department, followed by increased pressure from law enforcement could be the reason behind its exit from the ransomware business. Certainly, Babuk has not given up the encryption-based extortion game.

                    Earlier, the operators had announced that they were planning to release the malware code to the public. However, they have released a new version of their malware, indicating that they wish to get back into the ransomware business.
                    The gang made a comeback after announcing its departure from the ransomware business in favor of data theft extortion a few weeks ago.
                    The gang is now using a new version of its file-encrypting malware disguised as PayLoad Bin, and its news leak site showed little activity recently.
                    Meanwhile, in a recent ransomware attack, the leaked Babuk builder was used. In this attack, the attackers demanded .006 bitcoin as ransom.</p>

                <h2>Morgan Stanley reports data breach after vendor Accellion hack #37</h2>
                <p>Investment banking firm Morgan Stanley has reported a data breach after attackers stole personal information belonging to its customers by hacking into the Accellion FTA server of a third-party vendor.

                    Morgan Stanley is a leading global financial services firm providing investment banking, securities, wealth and investment management services worldwide.
                    
                    The American multinational company's clients include corporations, governments, institutions, and individuals in more than 41 countries. Guidehouse, a third-party vendor that provides account maintenance services to Morgan Stanley's StockPlan Connect business, notified the investment banking company in May 2021 that attackers hacked its Accellion FTA server to steal information belonging to Morgan Stanley stock plan participants.

                    The Guidehouse server was breached by exploiting an Accellion FTA vulnerability in January before the vendor patched it within five days of the fix becoming available.
                    
                    Guidehouse discovered the breach in March and the impact to Morgan Stanley customers in May, when it notified the financial services company of the incident and that no evidence was found of the stolen data being disseminated online by the threat actors.
                    
                    "There was no data security breach of any Morgan Stanley applications," Morgan Stanley said in data breach notification letters sent to impacted individuals.
                    
                    "The incident involves files which were in Guidehouse’s possession, including encrypted files from Morgan Stanley."
                    
                    However, even though the stolen files were stored in encrypted form on the compromised Guidehouse Accellion FTA server, the threat actors also obtained the decryption key during the attack. The company added that the files stolen from Guidehouse's FTA server did not contain passwords information or credentials that the threat actors could use to gain access to impacted Morgan Stanley customers' financial accounts.

                    "The protection of client data is of the utmost importance and is something we take very seriously," a Morgan Stanley spokesperson told BleepingComputer. "We are in close contact with Guidehouse and are taking steps to mitigate potential risks to clients." While the attackers' identity was not disclosed in Morgan Stanley's data breach notification, a joint statement published by Accellion and Mandiant from February shed more light on the attacks, directly linking them to the FIN11 cybercrime group.

                    The Clop ransomware gang has also used an Accellion FTA zero-day vulnerability (disclosed in December 2020) to steal data from multiple companies.
                    
                    Accellion has said that roughly 300 customers used the 20-year-old legacy FTA software, with less than 100 of them being breached in these attacks.
                    
                    Starting in January, BleepingComputer has reported multiple data breaches impacting companies and organizations after their Accellion FTA servers were compromised, allowing the cybercrime groups to exfiltrate sensitive information.
                    
                    So far, these threat actors have hit energy giant Shell, cybersecurity firm Qualys, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Singtel, supermarket giant Kroger, the Office of the Washington State Auditor ("SAO"), the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), and multiple universities and other organizations.
                    
                    In February, Five Eyes members have also issued a joint security advisory on these attacks and extortion attempts.</p>

                <h2>SideCopy Hackers Target Indian Government Officials With New Malware #36</h2>
                <p>A cyber-espionage group has been observed increasingly targeting Indian government personnel as part of a broad campaign to infect victims with as many as four new custom remote access trojans (RATs), signaling a "boost in their development operations."

                    Attributed to a group tracked as SideCopy, the intrusions culminate in the deployment of a variety of modular plugins, ranging from file enumerators to browser credential stealers and keyloggers (Xeytan and Lavao), Cisco Talos said in a report published Wednesday.
                    
                    "Targeting tactics and themes observed in SideCopy campaigns indicate a high degree of similarity to the Transparent Tribe APT (aka APT36) also targeting India," researchers Asheer Malhotra and Justin Thattil said. "These include using decoys posing as operational documents belonging to the military and think tanks and honeytrap-based infections."
                    
                    First documented in September 2020 by Indian cybersecurity firm Quick Heal, SideCopy has a history of mimicking infection chains implemented by the Sidewinder APT to deliver its own set of malware — in an attempt to mislead attribution and evade detection — while constantly retooling payloads that include additional exploits in its weaponry after a reconnaissance of the victim's data and environment. The adversary is also believed to be of Pakistani origin, with suspected ties to the Transparent Tribe (aka Mythic Leopard) group, which has been linked to several attacks targeting the Indian military and government entities. Past campaigns undertaken by the threat actor involve using government and military-related lures to single out Indian defense units and armed forces personnel and deliver malware capable of accessing files, clipboard data, terminating processes, and even executing arbitrary commands.

                    The latest wave of attacks leverages a multitude of TTPs, including malicious LNK files and decoy documents, to deliver a combination of bespoke and commercially available commodity RATs such as CetaRAT, DetaRAT, ReverseRAT, MargulasRAT, njRAT, Allakore, ActionRAT, Lillith, and Epicenter RAT. Apart from military themes, SideCopy has also been found employing calls for proposals and job openings related to think tanks in India to target potential victims.
                    
                    "The development of new RAT malware is an indication that this group of attackers is rapidly evolving its malware arsenal and post-infection tools since 2019," Malhotra and Thattil noted. The improvements demonstrate an effort to modularize the attack chains, while also demonstrating an increase in sophistication of the group's tactics, the researchers said.
                    
                    Besides deploying full-fledged backdoors, SideCopy has also been observed utilizing plugins to carry out specific malicious tasks on the infected endpoint, chief among which is a Golang-based module called "Nodachi" that's designed to conduct reconnaissance and steal files targeting a government-mandated two-factor authentication solution called Kavach, which is required to access email services. The goal, it appears, is to steal access credentials from Indian government employees with a focus on espionage, the researchers said, adding the threat actor developed droppers for MargulasRAT that masqueraded as installers for Kavach on Windows.

                    Malware researcher @0xrb, who is also independently tracking the campaign, reached out to The Hacker News with two more IPs used by SideCopy attackers to connect to the command-and-control server — 103[.]255.7.33 and 115[.]186.190.155 — both of which are located in the city of Islamabad, lending credence to the threat actor's Pakistani provenance.
                    
                    "What started as a simple infection vector by SideCopy to deliver a custom RAT (CetaRAT), has evolved into multiple variants of infection chains delivering several RATs," the researchers concluded. "The use of these many infection techniques — ranging from LNK files to self-extracting RAR EXEs and MSI-based installers — is an indication that the actor is aggressively working to infect their victims."</p>

                <h2>Details of over 200000 students leaked in cyberattack by DragonForce #35</h2>
                <p>A pro-Palestinian Malaysian hacker group known as “DragonForce” claimed that it hacked into AcadeME last week, stating “THE LARGEST AND MOST ADVANCED STUDENT AND GRADUATE RECRUITMENT NETWORK IN ISRAEL Hacked By DragonForce Malaysia” in a Telegram message on June 20. The details of about 280,000 students throughout Israel were leaked after a cyberattack targeted the AcadeME company, which services a number of colleges and universities throughout the country, last week.
                    AcadeME helps hundreds of thousands of students find jobs at thousands of companies. A pro-Palestinian Malaysian hacker group known as "DragonForce" claimed that it hacked into AcadeME last week, stating "THE LARGEST AND MOST ADVANCED STUDENT AND GRADUATE RECRUITMENT NETWORK IN ISRAEL Hacked By DragonForce Malaysia" in a Telegram message on June 20.
                    The group claimed that they leaked emails, passwords, first and last names, addresses and even phone numbers of students who were registered on AcadeME. DragonForce attacked screenshots of code, server addresses and a table including email addresses and names.
                    The hackers leaked the details of about 280,000 students who used the service since 2014, May Brooks-Kempler from the Think Safe Cyber Facebook group told Israeli media. The AcadeME site was taken offline and listed as "unavailable" as of Monday morning. A notice which appears when attempting to access the site said the site "should be back soon."
                    "This is an urgent call for all Hackers, Human Right Organizations and Activists all around the world to unite again and start campaign against Israhell, share what is really going on there, expose their terrorist activity to the world," wrote the hackers on Telegram. "We will never remain silent against israhell war activity."
                    Later on the same day, the group claimed that it leaked a "massive" number of Israeli passports.
                    The same group also launched DDos attacks against Israeli banks on Friday, including Bank of Israel, Bank Leumi and Mizrahi Tefahot.
                    Earlier this year, Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD) chief Yigal Unna warned that cyberattacks could disable Israeli academic institutions if proper action isn't taken to prepare for such situations.
                    "In light of repeated alerts and cyber incidents in the academic sector, the cyber threat posed exposes the institutions to a reasonable scenario of actual harm to the various operating systems –to the point of disabling the institution's activities, and further damage to the information assets and even the reputation of the institutions," wrote Unna in a letter to the Committee of the Heads of Universities at the time. The INCD chief warned that the extensive connectivity between academic institutions and other bodies and organizations could pose a risk to other bodies as well and may lead to liability.
                    The letter came 11 days after a cyberattack targeted Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, resulting in a breach in a number of its servers.
                    A combined team of researchers from the INCD and Ben-Gurion's Technologies, Innovation & Digital Division was formed after the breach was discovered, which worked to prevent information leaks and to contain the incident.
                    It is still unclear who carried out the attack.
                    A series of cyberattacks have plagued Israeli businesses and institutions in the past year, including Israel Aerospace Industries, the Shirbit insurance company and the Amital software company.
                    The National Cyber Directorate reported that it handled more than 11,000 inquiries on its 119 hotline in 2020, some 30% more than it handled in 2019. The directorate made about 5,000 requests to entities to handle vulnerabilities exposing them to attacks and was in contact with about 1,400 entities concerning attempted or successful attacks.</p>

                <h2>Ransomware gangs now creating websites to recruit affiliates #34</h2>
                <p>Ever since two prominent Russian-speaking cybercrime forums banned ransomware-related topics, criminal operations have been forced to promote their service through alternative methods.

                    At least two ransomware gangs in need of hackers to run the attacks have been using their sites to advertise features of their encryption tools to attract new recruits.
                    Showing off to tempt affiliates
                    
                    About a week ago, LockBit ransomware gang announced a new major version for their tool, claiming significant improvement for the encryption speed.
                    
                    To support their claim, the threat actor apparently tested versions of multiple ransomware pieces and published their measurements for file encryption speed.
                    
                    With launching LockBit 2.0, the ransomware developers also announced a new affiliate recruitment session, highlighting that the encryption they use has not faltered since the operation started in September 2019.
                    
                    “The only thing you have to do is to get access to the core server, while LockBit 2.0 will do all the rest. The launch is realized on all devices of the domain network in case of administrator rights on the domain controller,” says the LockBit ransomware gang.To attract partners, LockBit claims to offer the fastest encryption and file-stealing (StealBit) tools “all over the world.”

                    This move from LockBit comes after the actor in late May tried to get ransomware talks back on a popular Russian-speaking forum by proposing a private section only for “authoritative users, in whom there is no doubt.”
                    
                    While one user thought this to be a good idea, they also pointed out that the ransomware topic “is now better known than ISIS terrorists,” meaning that the forum would get unwanted attention. Another gang promoting their ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation on their website recently is Himalaya, an actor that started its activity this year.

                    Except for using their site to spread the word, Himalaya does not seem any different than other ransomware programs. They advertise a 70% commission for affiliates and an “already configured and compiled FUD [Fully UnDetectable]” file-encrypting malware.
                    
                    As seen from the announcement below, Himalaya lays out a strict rule about the targets and apparently does not allow attacking healthcare, public, and non-profit organizations.</p>

                <h2>REvil ransomware's new Linux encryptor targets ESXi virtual machines #33</h2>
                <p>The REvil ransomware operation is now using a Linux encryptor that targets and encrypts Vmware ESXi virtual machines.

                    With the enterprise moving to virtual machines for easier backups, device management, and efficient use of resources, ransomware gangs increasingly create their own tools to mass encrypt storage used by VMs.
                    
                    In May, Advanced Intel's Yelisey Boguslavskiy shared a forum post from the REvil operation where they confirmed that they had released a Linux version of their encryptor that could also work on NAS devices. Today, security researcher MalwareHunterTeam found a Linux version of the REvil ransomware (aka Sodinokibi) that also appears to target ESXi servers.

                    Advanced Intel's Vitali Kremez, who analyzed the new REvil Linux variant, told BleepingComputer it is an ELF64 executable and includes the same configuration options utilized by the more common Windows executable.
                    
                    Kremez states that this is the first known time the Linux variant has been publicly available since it was released.
                    
                    When executed on a server, a threat actor can specify the path to encrypt and enable a silent mode. When executed on ESXi servers, it will run the esxcli command line tool to list all running ESXi virtual machines and terminate them. By targeting virtual machines this way, REvil can encrypt many servers at once with a single command.

                    Wosar told BleepingComputer that other ransomware operations, such as Babuk, RansomExx/Defray, Mespinoza, GoGoogle, DarkSide, and Hellokitty have also created Linux encryptors to target ESXi virtual machines.
                    
                    "The reason why most ransomware groups implemented a Linux-based version of their ransomware is to target ESXi specifically," said Wosar.</p>

                <h2>Cisco ASA Flaw Under Active Attack After PoC Exploit Posted Online #32</h2>
                <p>A security vulnerability in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) that was addressed by the company last October and again earlier this April, has been subjected to active in-the-wild attacks following the release of proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code.

                    The PoC was published by researchers from cybersecurity firm Positive Technologies on June 24, following which reports emerged that attackers are chasing after an exploit for the bug.
                    
                    "Tenable has also received a report that attackers are exploiting CVE-2020-3580 in the wild," the cyber exposure company said.Tracked as CVE-2020-3580 (CVSS score: 6.1), the issue concerns multiple vulnerabilities in the web services interface of Cisco ASA software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) software that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on an affected device.

                    As of July 2020, there were a little over 85,000 ASA/FTD devices, 398 of which are spread across 17% of the Fortune 500 companies, according to cybersecurity company Rapid7.
                    
                    Successful exploitation, such as scenarios where a user of the interface is convinced to click a specially-crafted link, could permit the adversary to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
                    
                    Although Cisco remediated the flaw in October 2020, the network equipment company subsequently determined the fix be "incomplete," thereby requiring a second round of patches that were released on April 28, 2021.
                    
                    In light of public PoC availability, it's recommended that organizations prioritize patching CVE-2020-3580 to mitigate the risk associated with the flaw.</p>

                <h2>Nobelium hackers accessed Microsoft customer support tools #31</h2>
                <p>Microsoft says they have discovered new attacks conducted by the Russian state-sponsored Nobelium hacking group, including a hacked Microsoft support agent's computer that exposed customer's subscription information.

                    Nobelium is Microsoft's name for a state-sponsored hacking group believed to be operating out of Russia responsible for the SolarWinds supply-chain attacks. 
                    
                    In a new blog post published Friday night, Microsoft states that the hacking group has been conducting password spray and brute-force attacks to gain access to corporate networks.
                    
                    Password spray and brute force attacks are similar in that they both attempt to gain unauthorized accounts to an online account by guessing a password. However, password spray attacks will attempt to use the same passwords across multiple accounts simultaneously to evade defenses. In contrast, brute force attacks repeatedly target a single account with different password attempts.
                    
                    Microsoft says that Nobelium's recent attacks have been mostly unsuccessful. However, they know of three entities that were breached by Nobelium in these attacks.
                    
                    "This activity was targeted at specific customers, primarily IT companies (57%), followed by government (20%), and smaller percentages for non-governmental organizations and think tanks, as well as financial services," Microsoft said in a blog post about the attacks.
                    
                    "The activity was largely focused on US interests, about 45%, followed by 10% in the UK, and smaller numbers from Germany and Canada.  In all, 36 countries were targeted." During the investigation into the attacks, Microsoft also detected an information-stealing trojan on a Microsoft customer support agent's computer that provided access to "basic account information" for a limited number of customers.

                    Nobelium used this customer information in targeted phishing attacks against Microsoft customers.
                    
                    Microsoft reported these attacks after Reuters obtained an email sent to affected customers warning them that the threat actors gained access to information about their Microsoft Services subscriptions.
                    
                    "A sophisticated Nation-State associated actor that Microsoft identifies as NOBELLIUM accessed Microsoft customer support tools to review information regarding your Microsoft Services subscriptions," read the Microsoft email obtained by Reuters. </p>

                <h2>NFC flaws let researchers hack an ATM by waving a phone #30</h2>
                <p>Flaws in card-reader technology can wreak havoc with point-of-sale systems and more.
                    For years, security researchers and cybercriminals have hacked ATMs by using all possible avenues to their innards, from opening a front panel and sticking a thumb drive into a USB port to drilling a hole that exposes internal wiring. Now, one researcher has found a collection of bugs that allow him to hack ATMs—along with a wide variety of point-of-sale terminals—in a new way: with a wave of his phone over a contactless credit card reader.

                    Josep Rodriguez, a researcher and consultant at security firm IOActive, has spent the last year digging up and reporting vulnerabilities in the so-called near-field communications reader chips used in millions of ATMs and point-of-sale systems worldwide. NFC systems are what let you wave a credit card over a reader—rather than swipe or insert it—to make a payment or extract money from a cash machine. You can find them on countless retail store and restaurant counters, vending machines, taxis, and parking meters around the globe. Now Rodriguez has built an Android app that allows his smartphone to mimic those credit card radio communications and exploit flaws in the NFC systems' firmware. With a wave of his phone, he can exploit a variety of bugs to crash point-of-sale devices, hack them to collect and transmit credit card data, invisibly change the value of transactions, and even lock the devices while displaying a ransomware message. Rodriguez says he can even force at least one brand of ATMs to dispense cash—though that "jackpotting" hack only works in combination with additional bugs he says he has found in the ATMs' software. He declined to specify or disclose those flaws publicly due to nondisclosure agreements with the ATM vendors.

                    "You can modify the firmware and change the price to one dollar, for instance, even when the screen shows that you're paying 50 dollars. You can make the device useless, or install a kind of ransomware. There are a lot of possibilities here," says Rodriguez of the point-of-sale attacks he discovered. "If you chain the attack and also send a special payload to an ATM's computer, you can jackpot the ATM—like cash out, just by tapping your phone." Rodriguez says he alerted the affected vendors—which include ID Tech, Ingenico, Verifone, Crane Payment Innovations, BBPOS, Nexgo, and the unnamed ATM vendor—to his findings between seven months and a year ago. Even so, he warns that the sheer number of affected systems and the fact that many point-of-sale terminals and ATMs don't regularly receive software updates—and in many cases require physical access to update—mean that many of those devices likely remain vulnerable. "Patching so many hundreds of thousands of ATMs physically, it's something that would require a lot of time," Rodriguez says.

                    As a demonstration of those lingering vulnerabilities, Rodriguez shared a video with WIRED in which he waves a smartphone over the NFC reader of an ATM on the street in Madrid, where he lives, and causes the machine to display an error message. The NFC reader appears to crash and no longer reads his credit card when he next touches it to the machine. (Rodriguez asked that WIRED not publish the video for fear of legal liability. He also didn't provide a video demo of a jackpotting attack because, he says, he could only legally test it on machines obtained as part of IOActive's security consulting to the affected ATM vendor, with whom IOActive has signed an NDA.)

                    The findings are "excellent research into the vulnerability of software running on embedded devices," says Karsten Nohl, the founder of security firm SRLabs and a well-known firmware hacker, who reviewed Rodriguez's work. But Nohl points to a few drawbacks that reduce its practicality for real-world thieves. A hacked NFC reader would only be able to steal mag-stripe credit card data, not the victim's PIN or the data from EMV chips. And the fact that the ATM cashout trick would require an extra, distinct vulnerability in a target ATM's code is no small caveat, Nohl says.

                    But security researchers like the late IOActive hacker Barnaby Jack and the team at Red Balloon Security have been able to uncover those ATM vulnerabilities for years and have even shown that hackers can trigger ATM jackpotting remotely. Red Balloon CEO and chief scientist Ang Cui says that he's impressed by Rodriguez's findings and has little doubt that hacking the NFC reader could lead to dispensing cash in many modern ATMs, despite IOActive withholding some details of its attack. "I think it's very plausible that once you have code execution on any of these devices, you should be able to get right to the main controller, because that thing is full of vulnerabilities that haven't been fixed for over a decade," Cui says. "From there," he adds, "you can absolutely control the cassette dispenser" that holds and releases cash to users. Rodriguez, who has spent years testing the security of ATMs as a consultant, says he began exploring a year ago whether ATMs' contactless card readers—most often sold by the payment technology firm ID Tech—could serve as an in-road to hacking them. He began buying NFC readers and point-of-sale devices from eBay and soon discovered that many of them suffered from the same security flaw: they didn't validate the size of the data packet sent via NFC from a credit card to the reader, known as an application protocol data unit or APDU. By using a custom app to send a carefully crafted APDU from his NFC-enabled Android phone that's hundreds of times larger than the reader expects, Rodriguez was able to trigger a "buffer overflow," a decades-old type of software vulnerability that allows a hacker to corrupt a target device's memory and run their own code.

                    When WIRED reached out to the affected companies, ID Tech, BBPOS, and Nexgo didn't respond to requests for comment, and the ATM Industry Association declined to comment. Ingenico responded in a statement that, due to its security mitigations, Rodriguez's buffer overflow technique could only crash its devices, not gain code execution on them, but that, "considering the inconvenience and the impact for our customers," it issued a fix anyway. (Rodriguez counters that he's doubtful that Ingenico's mitigations would actually prevent code execution, but he hasn't actually created a proof of concept to demonstrate this.)

                    Verifone, for its part, said that it had found and fixed the point-of-sale vulnerabilities Rodriguez highlighted in 2018 long before he had reported them. But Rodriguez argues that this only demonstrates the lack of consistent patching in the company's devices; he says he tested his NFC techniques on a Verifone device in a restaurant last year and found that it remained vulnerable.

                    After keeping many of his findings under wraps for a full year, Rodriguez plans to share the technical details of the vulnerabilities in a webinar in the coming weeks, in part to push customers of the affected vendors to implement the patches that the companies have made available. But he also wants to call attention to the abysmal state of embedded device security more broadly. He was shocked to find that vulnerabilities as simple as buffer overflows have lingered in so many commonly used devices—ones that handle cash and sensitive financial information, no less.

                    "These vulnerabilities have been present in firmware for years, and we’re using these devices daily to handle our credit cards, our money," he says. "They need to be secured."</p>

                <h2>A New Attack on AI-driven Facial Recognition Systems #29</h2>
                <p>Researchers from Adversa have developed an attack technique named Adversarial Octopus that could perform a targeted attack on facial recognition systems. It impacts several current AI-driven facial recognition tools, exposing them to severe attacks. Researchers developed this new attack on AI-driven facial recognition systems that can change photos in such a way that an AI system will recognize a different person or as any person of choice.

                    The main characteristic of this attack is that it can target various AI implementations such as physical devices and online APIs. It can adapt to the targeted environment.
                    This type of attack may be used in both evasion scenarios such as making stealth deep fakes and poisoning scenarios by fooling computer vision algorithms and may lead to serious consequences.
                    The attack is able to bypass facial recognition services, applications, and APIs. Moreover, it impacts the most advanced online facial recognition search engine known as PimEyes. This Adversarial Octopus attack on PimEyes is developed with the following techniques from the attack framework:

                    To provide better Transferability, it was trained on various facial recognition models together with random blur and noise.
                    For better Accuracy, the system was created to calculate adversarial changes in every layer of a neural network and uses a random face detection frame.
                    For better Imperceptibility, it was optimized for minor changes to every pixel and uses special functions to smooth adversarial noise. This attack shows that AI systems require much more attention on the security front, and such new attack methods will help raise awareness. It will help enterprises deal with problems that exist in the present adversarial machine learning systems. Moreover, researchers are coordinating with enterprises to protect their AI applications from this attack.</p>

                <h2>Malicious Cryptominers Target Software Repositories to Burn a Hole in Your Wallet #28</h2>
                <p>Sonatype researchers have recently discovered malicious packages in PyPI, a software code repository, that turns developers’ workstations into cryptomining machines.

                    A supply-chain attack
                    Every malicious package could be exploited to trigger a supply-chain attack, impacting different projects with infostealers or cryptominers.
                    
                        Experts found six malicious packages, namely maratlib, maratlib1, matplatlib-plus, mllearnlib, mplatlib, and learninglib hidden inside the PyPI repository.
                        The same user uploaded all the malicious packages in an attempt to trick developers into downloading them and it worked.
                        There were about 5,000 downloads since April, even though there were instances of misspelled names of legitimate Python projects.
                        Actors embedded malicious code in setup[.]py file, a build script that would execute during the installation.
                    
                    
                    Diving into the details
                    Open-source code repositories such as PyPI, GitHub, or RubyGems are under constant attack from threat actors to mine cryptocurrency.
                    
                        While studying this particular case, researchers found that actors attempted to download a Bash script (aza2.sh) from a GitHub repository that is no longer available.
                        Further, it was found that the script’s role was to run Ubqminer cryptominer on the compromised machines.
                        In a separate attempt, the script contained another cryptomining program that utilizes GPU power, the open-source T-Rex. Cryptocurrency makes an effective target
                        There is currently an incessant series of attacks against cryptocurrency platforms and their users.
                        
                            Threat actors were found mailing fake replacement devices to Ledger customers to steal from their cryptocurrency wallets. The data of 272,853 people who purchased a Ledger device was exposed in a December breach.
                            According to research, cryptojacking is one of the most common discussion topics that hackers resort to dominate in cybercriminal forums.
                            Moreover, a report suggested that Australians paid over two million dollars in BTC and other cryptocurrencies to cybercriminals last year.
                            A fourfold spike in cryptomining attacks was observed during Q1, 2020, as the price of BTC steeply shot up during that time. </p>

                <h2>A Hacker Is Remotely Wiping People’s Internet-Connected Hard Drives #26</h2>
                <p>Users of Western Digital's WD My Book Live devices are reporting that all of their data has been remotely wiped by hackers exploiting a vulnerability. Users of WD My Book Live hard drives are reporting finding that their storage devices had been completely wiped by a remote factory reset. 

                    WD My Book Live products, which are manufactured by Western Digital and can have anywhere from 2TB to 24TB of storage, can be accessed remotely over the internet through their My Cloud function. On Thursday, owners of the devices began posting on Western Digital's forums that their data was being wiped. 
                    
                    “It is very scary and devastating that someone can do factory restore on my drive without any permission granted from the end user,” user “Sunpeak” wrote. They also included a portion of their system log which showed a factory reset happening around 3pm on June 23rd. 
                    
                    “I have lost 4TB of data, this includes all my insurance policies, budgets, the usual ‘life admin,’ as well as all the photos of my children, my wedding, etc but just as importantly my livelihood,” user “Sammie101” wrote. “I am an independent consultant and my last 7 months of project work is all gone.”
                    
                    Sammie101 wrote that they hadn’t heard back from Western Digital since reporting the problem and have instead shipped their hard drive to a professional recovery service.
                    
                    Western Digital did not respond to Motherboard for comment, but the company released a statement confirming that the devices' internet connectivity was what allowed them to be remotely wiped and recommending that users disconnect their drives from the internet. "Western Digital has determined that some My Book Live and My Book Live Duo devices are being compromised through exploitation of a remote command execution vulnerability," the statement read. "In some cases, this compromise has led to a factory reset that appears to erase all data on the device. The My Book Live and My Book Live Duo devices received its final firmware update in 2015. We understand that our customers’ data is very important. We are actively investigating the issue and will provide an updated advisory when we have more information."

                    The statement also referred to the National Vulnerability Database, where it stated that all versions of the WD My Book Live have a bug in the remote command function that can be accessed by anyone who knows the device’s IP address. 
                    
                    In an earlier post on the company's forums, Western Digital blamed the reset on “malicious software.” The intent of the factory reset is unclear since it doesn’t seem like anything other than users’ personal files were impacted, nor is it known who is responsible. It is also unclear how many people have been impacted by the remote factory reset.</p>

                <h2>Mercedes-Benz data breach exposes SSNs, credit card numbers #25</h2>
                <p>Mercedes-Benz USA has just disclosed a data breach impacting some of its customers.

                    The company assessed 1.6 million customer records which included customer names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, and some purchased vehicle information to determine the impact.
                    
                    It appears the data breach exposed credit card information, social security numbers, and driver license numbers of under 1,000 Mercedes-Benz customers and potential buyers. Data breach impact disclosed after auditing 1.6 million records

                    Yesterday, German automotive brand and luxury vehicle company, Mercedez-Benz disclosed a data breach impacting some customers and potential buyers.
                    
                    On June 11th, a Mercedes-Benz vendor informed the company that the personal information of select customers was exposed due to an insufficiently secured cloud storage instance.
                    
                    According to the company, the breach affects some customers and potential vehicle buyers who had entered sensitive information on Mercedez-Benz company and dealer websites between 2014 and 2017:
                    
                    "It is our understanding the information was entered by customers and interested buyers on dealer and Mercedes-Benz websites between January 1, 2014 and June 19, 2017."
                    
                    "No Mercedes-Benz system was compromised as a result of this incident, and at this time, we have no evidence that any Mercedes-Benz files were maliciously misused."
                    
                    "Data security is a serious matter for MBUSA. Our vendor confirmed that the issue is corrected and that such an event cannot be replicated."
                    
                    "We will continue our investigation to ensure that this situation is properly addressed,"  said Mercedes-Benz in a press release.
                    
                    The vendor who notified Mercedez-Benz of the data breach states that the exposed information included:
                    
                        Self-reported customer credit scores
                        Driver license numbers
                        Social Security Numbers (SSNs)
                        Credit card numbers
                        Dates of Birth
                        However, the company has stated that this information would not have been searchable on or indexed by a typical search engine.

                        "To view the information, one would need knowledge of special software programs and tools - an Internet search would not return any information contained in these files," says Mercedes-Benz.
                        
                        The company released this data breach statement after reviewing almost 1.6 million unique customer records, which included name, address, emails, phone numbers, and some purchased vehicle information.
                        
                        But, upon the completion of the investigation, it was determined that under 1,000 customers have had their "additional" personal information exposed via publicly accessible cloud storage solution. 
                        
                        Mercedes-Benz USA says that it is in the process of contacting the affected individuals about this incident whose additional information was accessible.
                        
                        "Any individual who had credit card information, a driver’s license number or a social security number included in the data will be offered complimentary 24-month subscription to a credit monitoring service. We will also notify the appropriate government agencies," says the vehicle company.
                        
                        Because the company mentions only under 1,000 customers had their additional information exposed, after auditing 1.6 million customer records, it is not clear exactly how many customers were affected by this incident.

                <h2>The Week in Ransomware - June 25th 2021 - Back in Business #24</h2>
                <p>It has been relatively quiet this week, with few attacks revealed and few new ransomware variants released. However, some interesting information came out that we have summarized below.

                    Last week, a law enforcement operation arrestest numerous Clop Ransomware gang members, assisted by the Binance cryptocurrency exchange which helped track the threat actors performing money laundering for the Clop ransomware.
                    
                    However, this did not seem to stop the ransomware gang for long as they continued to release the data of new victims this week.
                    
                    The City of Tulsa also reported a data breach this week after the Conti ransomware gang began leaking stolen police citations online on their data leak site.
                    
                    This week's most significant attack was against Brazilian medical diagnostics giant Grupo Fleury who was hit with an REvil ransomware attack.</p>

                <h2>Crackonosh virus mined $2 million of Monero from 222,000 hacked computers #23</h2>
                <p>A previously undocumented Windows malware has infected over 222,000 systems worldwide since at least June 2018, yielding its developer no less than 9,000 Moneros ($2 million) in illegal profits.

                    Dubbed "Crackonosh," the malware is distributed via illegal, cracked copies of popular software, only to disable antivirus programs installed in the machine and install a coin miner package called XMRig for stealthily exploiting the infected host's resources to mine Monero.
                    
                    At least 30 different versions of the malware executable have been discovered between Jan. 1, 2018, and Nov. 23, 2020, Czech cybersecurity software company Avast said on Thursday, with a majority of the victims located in the U.S., Brazil, India, Poland, and the Philippines.
                    
                    Crackonosh works by replacing critical Windows system files such as serviceinstaller.msi and maintenance.vbs to cover its tracks and abuses the safe mode, which prevents antivirus software from working, to delete Windows Defender (and other installed solutions) and turn off automatic updates. As part of its anti-detection and anti-forensics tactics, the malware also installs its own version of "MSASCuiL.exe" (i.e., Windows Defender), which puts the icon of Windows Security with a green tick to the system tray and runs tests to determine if it's running in a virtual machine.

                    Last December, security researcher Roberto Franceschetti disclosed that antivirus applications could be disabled by booting into safe mode and renaming their application directories before their corresponding services are launched in Windows.
                    
                    Microsoft, however, said the issue doesn't "meet the bar for security servicing," noting that the attack is predicated on having administrative/root privileges, adding a "malicious administrator can do much worse things." The development also comes as a suspected Chinese threat actor behind DirtyMoe and Purple Fox malware were found to have compromised about 100,000 Windows machines as part of an evolving cryptojacking campaign dating all the way back to 2017.

                    "Crackonosh shows the risks in downloading cracked software," Avast security researcher Daniel Beneš said. "As long as people continue to download cracked software, attacks like these will continue and continue to be profitable for attackers. The key take-away from this is that you really can't get something for nothing and when you try to steal software, odds are someone is trying to steal from you."</p>

                <h2>FIN7 Supervisor Gets 7-Year Jail Term for Stealing Millions of Credit Cards #22</h2>
                <p>A Ukrainian national and a mid-​level supervisor of the hacking group known as FIN7 has been sentenced to seven years in prison for his role as a "pen tester" and perpetuating a criminal scheme that enabled the gang to compromise millions of customers debit and credit cards.

                    Andrii Kolpakov, 33, was arrested in Spain on June 28, 2018, and subsequently extradited to the U.S. the following year on June 1, 2019. In June 2020, Kolpakov pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking.
                    
                    The Western District of Washington also ordered Kolpakov to pay $2.5 million in restitution.
                    
                    The defendant, who was involved with the group from April 2016 until his arrest, managed other hackers who were tasked with breaching the point-of-sale systems of companies, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, to deploy malware capable of stealing financial information.
                    
                    FIN7, also called Anunak, Carbanak Group, and the Navigator Group, is said to have engaged in a sophisticated malware campaign at least since 2015 targeting restaurant, gambling, and hospitality industries in the U.S. to plunder credit and debit card numbers that were then used or sold for profit on underground forums. According to court documents, FIN7 used a firm called Combi Security as a front to recruit hackers — one of them being Kolpakov — to "provide a veil of legitimacy to the illegal enterprise," while projecting itself as "one of the leading international companies" that offered penetration testing services to customers worldwide.

                    "FIN7 carefully crafted email messages that would appear legitimate to a business's employees and accompanied emails with telephone calls intended to further legitimize the emails," the Department of Justice (DoJ) said in a release. "Once an attached file was opened and activated, FIN7 would use an adapted version of the Carbanak malware, in addition to an arsenal of other tools, to access and steal payment card data for the business's customers."
                    
                    The total damages stemming from these intrusions exceeded $1 billion, the DoJ said.
                    
                    Kolpakov is the second member of the FIN7 group to be sentenced in the U.S. since the start of the year. In April, another 35-year-old Ukrainian national Fedir Hladyr was awarded 10 years in prison for his role as a high-level manager and systems administrator responsible for maintaining the server infrastructure that FIN7 used to attack and control victims' machines.</p>

                <h2>Watch Out! Zyxel Firewalls and VPNs Under Active Cyberattack #21</h2>
                <p>Taiwanese networking equipment company Zyxel is warning customers of an ongoing attack targeting a "small subset" of its security products such as firewall and VPN servers.

                    Attributing the attacks to a "sophisticated threat actor," the firm noted that the attacks single out appliances that have remote management or SSL VPN enabled, namely in the USG/ZyWALL, USG FLEX, ATP, and VPN series running on-premise ZLD firmware, implying that the targeted devices are publicly accessible over the internet.
                    
                    "The threat actor attempts to access a device through WAN; if successful, they then bypass authentication and establish SSL VPN tunnels with unknown user accounts, such as 'zyxel_slIvpn', 'zyxel_ts', or 'zyxel_vpn_test', to manipulate the device's configuration," Zyxel said in an email message, which was shared on Twitter. It is not know if the attacks are exploiting previously known vulnerabilities in Zyxel devices or if they leverage a zero-day flaw to breach the systems. Also unclear is the scale of the attack and the number of users affected.

                    To reduce the attack surface, the company is recommending customers to disable HTTP/HTTPS services from the WAN and implement a list of restricted geo-IP to enable remote access only from trusted locations.
                    
                    Earlier this year, Zyxel patched a critical vulnerability in its firmware to remove a hard-coded user account "zyfwp" (CVE-2020-29583) that could be abused by an attacker to login with administrative privileges and compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the device. The development comes as enterprise VPNs and other network devices have become a top target of attackers in a series of campaigns aimed at finding new avenues into corporate networks, giving the threat actors the ability to laterally move across the network and gather sensitive intelligence for espionage and other financially-motivated operations.</p>

                <h2>Founders of South African Crypto Investment Firm – and $3.6B in Bitcoin – Are Missing #20</h2>
                <p>The founders of South Africa-based crypto investment firm Africrypt have disappeared along with 69,000 bitcoins – worth an estimated $3.6 billion – according to a report from Bloomberg on Wednesday.

                    In mid-April, Africrypt’s investors were sent an email claiming the platform was shutting down and freezing all accounts following a hack that compromised client accounts, wallets and nodes. Investors were reportedly asked not to report the hack to law enforcement, which the founders claimed would slow the recovery process.
                    
                    However, shortly after the so-called hack, Africrypt’s founders – 20-year-old Ameer Cajee and 17-year-old Raees Cajee – allegedly transferred the pooled investor funds from an account at Johannesburg-based First National Bank (FNB) and disappeared to the U.K. Since freezing the accounts, the Cajee brothers apparently shuttered Africrypt’s website and have not returned investors’ calls. The incident follows closely after the South African Mirror Trading International (MTI) crypto scam, which defrauded investors of over $589 million, according to Chainalysis’ “2021 Crypto Crime Report.” Crypto scams are nothing new, but Africrypt could rank as one of the largest crypto cons in history.
    
                    Hanekom Attorneys, the Cape Town-based law firm hired by some of AfriCrypt’s investors, told Bloomberg the funds were put through a variety of tumblers and mixers, making them virtually untraceable. The lawyers also said various global exchanges have been alerted about the alleged theft so they can keep an eye out for any attempts to convert the bitcoins. 
                    
                    A separate group of investors have started liquidation proceedings against Africrypt.
                    
                    The alleged crime has been reported to the Hawks, a speciality division of the South African police force that deals with organized and economic crime. However, the government’s ability to investigate the matter is constrained by the lack of regulatory framework on digital assets in South Africa, which does not consider cryptocurrencies a financial product.</p>

                <h2>FBI Hacking and Tech Contracts Are Vanishing from the Web #19</h2>
                <p>A contract for a set of hacking tools and another from Coinbase have been removed from a U.S. government website. A U.S. government contract website that is supposed to show the public what agencies are spending money on is quietly removing listings detailing the FBI's purchase of hacking tools and other products, Motherboard has found.

                    In March, Motherboard reported that the FBI paid anti-child predator charity The Innocent Lives Foundation $250,000 for a set of network investigative techniques, the Department of Justice's overarching term for hacking tools. Motherboard discovered the sale due to a listing on the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), a site for searching U.S. government purchases. In a phone call with Motherboard at the time, Chris Hadnagy, CEO of the charity, said that the listing included his personal information.
                    
                    The listing is no longer available on the FPDS. Hadnagy did not respond to an emailed question asking if he requested the removal.
                    
                    Another FBI contract has disappeared from FPDS recently. This one involves cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which also sells an analytics product. While Motherboard previously viewed the relevant listing on the FPDS, it is no longer available. Some of the removals are likely due to a legitimate concern of private individuals unknowingly having their phone numbers or other personal information posted to the contracting sites and asking for that to be removed. But instead of just deleting or altering that data, the site is removing the listings in their entirety, meaning that the government is ultimately being less transparent around technologies it is purchasing.

                    "Transparency of federal spending ensures that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely. While there are timing delays and completeness problems with federal spending data, the public deserves to see what the federal government is buying and for how much, and Congress should be enhancing spending transparency laws so that we have a more complete picture," Scott Amey, general counsel at watchdog group the Project on Government Oversight, told Motherboard in an email.
                    
                    Coinbase told Motherboard that a party acting on the company's behalf did reach out to Tech Inquiry, a site that mirrors the FPDS data, about exposed personal information. Jack Poulson who runs Tech Inquiry showed Motherboard emails related to this request. Coinbase said it did not know if it asked FPDS for a removal as well. "Our client, Coinbase, has discovered an incorrect phone number being displayed on the following URL," an email from cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to Poulson reads.

                    The FBI and the General Services Administration (GSA) which maintains the FPDS declined to comment.</p>

                <h2>Scammer arrested for phishing operation, sent 25,000 texts in a day #18</h2>
                <p>The police has arrested an individual last week for sending fraudulent text messages to thousands of people to obtain banking details and defraud them.

                    It is estimated that the man sent more than 25,000 short text messages in one day, from SIM cards on multiple mobile devices. The arrest took place on June 17 at a hotel in Manchester, UK, where the 21-years old fraudster had taken a room and used it as the headquarters of the phishing operation.

                    The fraudster is likely part of a larger gang and is probably just a foot soldier doing the risky part of the business for the more important players that run the larger operation.
                    
                    Police officers found electronic equipment that could be used for SMS phishing, also known as smishing. The text messages claimed to be from the Hermes parcel delivery company.
                    
                    According to the police, the operation was quite large and could deliver tens of thousands of fraudulent messages every day. It is estimated that close to 26,000 texts were sent on the day of the arrest.
                    
                    At least some of the messages were sent through EE, one of the largest mobile network operators and internet service providers in the United Kingdom, with over 27 million subscribers.
                    
                    The messages informed potential victims of a missed delivery and asked for banking information. The number of individuals falling victim to the scam remains undisclosed.
                    
                    After examining the seized devices, the police say that they stored a total of 44,000 mobile phone contacts. Despite the size of the phishing operation, the man got caught when the hotel staff deemed him suspicious for carrying a large number of cables in a bag and alerted the police in Manchester.

                    “What we have uncovered here are potentially the components of a highly sophisticated and authentic scam that I know many people not just in Greater Manchester but across the country have been potential victims of in recent weeks and months” - Mark Astbury, Detective Inspector of Greater Manchester Police’s City of Manchester Central division
                    
                    People in the UK receiving suspicious text messages allegedly from Hermes should report the phishing attempt, contact the police online, or call 101.
                    
                    As a side note, the fraudster's opsec skills are not the only ones needing an improvement. Phishing kit expert JCyberSec noticed that the Manchester police did not remove the metadata in the image published with the press release. Althlugh it is not the case now, metadata can include potentially sensitive information.</p>

                <h2>Healthcare giant Grupo Fleury hit by REvil ransomware attack #17</h2>
                <p>Brazilian medical diagnostic company Grupo Fleury has suffered a ransomware attack that has disrupted business operations after the company took its systems offline.

                    Grupo Fleury is the largest medical diagnostics company in Brazil, with over 200 service centers and more than 10,000 employees. The company performs approximately 75 million clinical exams in a year.
                    
                    Starting yesterday, the Fleury website began displaying an alert warning that they suffered an attack and that systems are no longer accessible. "Please be advised that our systems are currently unavailable and that we are prioritizing the restoration of services," read the alert translated into English.

                    "The causes of this unavailability originated from the attempted external attack on our systems, which are having operations reestablished with all the resources and technical efforts for the rapid standardization of our services."
                    
                    With their systems shut down, business operations are disrupted, and patients are unable to schedule lab tests or other clinical exams online. While local media has received confirmation that the company has suffered a cyberattack, Grupo Fleury has not officially confirmed a ransomware attack.

                    However, multiple cybersecurity sources have told BleepingComputer that Grupo Fleury suffered an attack by the ransomware operation known as REvil, also known as Sodinokibi.
                    
                    This ransomware operation is responsible for numerous high-profile attacks, including Brazil's Rio Grande do Sul court system, nuclear weapons contractor Sol Oriens, and JBS, the world's largest meat producer.
                    
                    In a sample of the ransomware used in the attack and shared with BleepingComputer, the REvil ransomware operation is demanding $5 million to receive a decryptor and not leak allegedly stolen files. REvil is known for stealing files before encrypting devices and then using the stolen data as leverage to get a company to pay the ransom.

                    From the ransomware sample, no proof of stolen data or mention of the victim's name has been shared by the attackers at this time.
                    
                    If data has been stolen, Grupo Fleury's data is of significant concern as it could contain enormous amounts of personal and medical data of patients.
                    
                    BleepingComputer has contacted Grupo Fleury with further questions but has not received a response at this time.</p>

                <h2>McAfee founder found dead in Barcenlona prison #16</h2>
                <p>John McAfee has been found dead in mysterious circumstances inside a prison cell in Barcelona, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, the developer and programmer of one of the first and most popular commercial antivirus tools, and the founder of cybersecurity firm McAfee.
                    John McAfee was awaiting extradition to the United States after the Spanish court today approved his extradition request, and the US Department of Justice indicted him for tax evasion and fraud, and he was arrested by Spanish police at El Prat Airport in October while trying to travel to Turkey.
                    John McAfee founded and ran software company McAfee Associates from 1987 to 1994, where he created McAfees's first commercial antivirus software, then quit the company and founded dozens of other companies, repeatedly causing controversy with statements he made on his Twitter account.
                    The Department of Justice said that McAfee did not pay taxes on millions of dollars earned through the cryptocurrency system and defrauded the institution's investors.
                    In his last message posted on his Twitter account on June 16, "by the lawyer or one of his associates," McAfee continued to deny the charges against him writing:
                    "The US believes I have hidden crypto. I wish I did but it has dissolved through the many hands of Team McAfee (your belief is not required), and my remaining assets are all seized. My friends evaporated through fear of association.
                    I have nothing. Yet, I regret nothing.".

                <h2>ADATA suffers 700 GB data leak in Ragnar Locker ransomware attack #14</h2>
                <p>The Ragnar Locker ransomware gang have published download links for more than 700GB of archived data stolen from Taiwanese memory and storage chip maker ADATA.

                    A set of 13 archives, allegedly containing sensitive ADATA files, have been publicly available at a cloud-based storage service, at least for some time. On Saturday, the ransomware actor published on their leak site the download links to a new set of ADATA corporate documents, warning interested parties that the links would not survive for long.

                    Ragnar Locker’s premonition proved true as MEGA storage service, where the gang chose to host the illegally obtained data, reacted and closed the threat actor’s account, denying access to any files they had shared publicly.
                    
                    Two of the leaked archives are quite large, weighing over 100GB, but several of them that could have been easily downloaded are less than 1.1GB large.
                    
                    Per the file metadata published by the threat actor, the largest archive is close to 300GB and its name gives no clue about what it might contain. Another large one is 117GB in size and its name is just as nondescript as in the case of the first one (Archive#2). Judging by the names of the archives, Ragnar Locker likely stole from ADATA documents containing financial information, non-disclosure agreements, among other type of details.

                    The ransomware attack on ADATA happened on May 23rd, 2021, forcing them to take systems offline. As the Ragnar Locker leak clearly shows, ADATA did not pay the ransom and restored the affected systems on its own.

                    The ransomware actor claims stealing 1.5TB of sensitive files before deploying the encryption routine, saying that they took their time in the process because of the poor network defenses.
                    
                    “So then, as usual, we did offer to cooperate to fix the vulnerabilities and to restore their system and of course, avoid any publication regarding this issue, however, they didn't value much their own private information, as well as partners/clients/employees/customers information” - Ragnar Locker
                    
                    The recently leaked batch of archives is the second one that Ragnar Locker ransomware publishes for ADATA. The previous one was posted earlier this month and includes four small 7-zip archives (less than 250MB together) that can still be downloaded.</p>

                <p>Open-source Tor browser has been updated to version 10.0.18 with fixes for multiple issues, including a privacy-defeating bug that could be used to uniquely fingerprint users across different browsers based on the apps installed on a computer.

                    In addition to updating Tor to 0.4.5.9, the browser's Android version has been upgraded to Firefox to version 89.1.1, alongside incorporating patches rolled out by Mozilla for several security vulnerabilities addressed in Firefox 89.
                    
                    Chief among the rectified issues is a new fingerprinting attack that came to light last month. Dubbed scheme flooding, the vulnerability enables a malicious website to leverage information about installed apps on the system to assign users a permanent unique identifier even when they switch browsers, use incognito mode, or a VPN.
                    
                    Put differently, the weakness takes advantage of custom URL schemes in apps as an attack vector, allowing a bad actor to track a device's user between different browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and even Tor, effectively circumventing cross-browser anonymity protections on Windows, Linux, and macOS. "A website exploiting the scheme flooding vulnerability could create a stable and unique identifier that can link those browsing identities together," FingerprintJS researcher Konstantin Darutkin said.

                    Currently, the attack checks a list of 24 installed applications that consists of Adobe, Battle.net, Discord, Epic Games, ExpressVPN, Facebook Messenger, Figma, Hotspot Shield, iTunes, Microsoft Word, NordVPN, Notion, Postman, Sketch, Skype, Slack, Spotify, Steam, TeamViewer, Telegram, Visual Studio Code, Xcode, WhatsApp, and Zoom.
                    
                    The issue has serious implications for privacy as it could be exploited by adversaries to unmask Tor users by correlating their browsing activities as they switch to a non-anonymizing browser, such as Google Chrome. To counter the attack, Tor now sets the "network.protocol-handler.external" to false so as to block the browser from probing installed apps.
                    
                    Of the other three browsers, while Google Chrome features built-in safeguards against scheme flooding — it prevents launching any application unless it's triggered by a user gesture, like a mouse click — the browser's PDF Viewer was found to bypass this mitigation.
                    
                    "Until this vulnerability is fixed, the only way to have private browsing sessions not associated with your primary device is to use another device altogether," Darutkin said. Tor browser users are recommended to move quickly to apply the update to ensure they are protected.
                    
                    The development arrives little over a week after encrypted messaging service Wire addressed two critical vulnerabilities in its iOS and web app that could lead to a denial-of-service (CVE-2021-32666) and permit an attacker to take control of a user account (CVE-2021-32683). </p>

                <h2>Audi And Volkswagen's Data Breach Affected 3.3 Million Customers #12</h2>
                <p>Volkswagen announced that a massive data breach exposed the personal information of over 3.3 million customers after one of its vendors left a cache of customer data unencrypted on the internet. In a letter to customers, Volkswagen said that the vendor utilized by Volkswagen, its subsidiary Audi, and authorized dealers in the United States and Canada had left customer data from 2014 to 2019 unsecured for two years between August 2019 and May 2021. 

                    Personal information about clients and potential buyers were included in the data, which was collected for sales and marketing purposes. Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (VWGoA) is the German Volkswagen Group's North American subsidiary, responsible for Volkswagen, Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, and VW Credit, Inc. operations in the United States and Canada. 
                    
                    Between August 2019 and May 2021, a vendor left insecure data accessible on the Internet, according to data breach notices submitted with the California and Maine Attorney General's offices. This specific vendor informed the VWGoA in March that an unauthorized person had gained access to the data and may have accessed customer information for Audi, Volkswagen, and some authorized dealers. 
                    
                    According to VWGoA authorities, the hack affected 3.3 million customers, with almost 97% of those affected being Audi customers or potential buyers. The data breach appears to have exposed information ranging from contact information to more sensitive data including social security numbers and loan numbers. 
                    
                    "The data included some or all of the following contact information about you: first and last name, personal or business mailing address, email address, or phone number. In some instances, the data also included information about a vehicle purchased, leased, or inquired about, such as the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), make, model, year, color, and trim packages," disclosed VWGoA in a data breach notification. 
                    
                    "The data also included more sensitive information relating to eligibility for purchase, loan, or lease. More than 95% of the sensitive data included was driver’s license numbers. There were also a very small number of dates of birth, Social Security or social insurance numbers, account or loan numbers, and tax identification numbers." The hackers are demanding between $4,000 and $5,000 for all of the records, claiming that the database contains no social security numbers. The threat actors earlier stated that the database for a VPN service provider with various Android apps on the Google Play Store was on sale for $1,000. 

                    Volkswagen is offering free credit protection and monitoring services to the 90,000 customers whose personal information was exposed, as well as $1 million in identity theft insurance.  </p>

                <h2>Latest Campaign by Molerats Hackers Target Middle Eastern Governments #11</h2>
                <p>After two months of break, a Middle Eastern advanced persistent-threat (APT) organization has resurfaced and is targeting government institutions in the Middle East -- global government bodies affiliated with geopolitics as a part of its recent malicious activities. 

                    Proofpoint, a company headquartered in Sunnyvale, ascribed this action to a politically motivated threat actor tracked as TA402, colloquially known as Molerats or GazaHackerTeam. 
                    
                    TA402 is supposed to work for objectives that are consistent with military or Palestinian state goals. The threat actor has been operating for a decade with a history of compromising associations mainly in Israel and Palestine. The attacks covered verticals such as technology, telecoms, finance, the academy, the army, the media, and governments. 
                    
                    The two months' break in the operation is not apparent, but the Proofpoint researchers have suggested that it could have played a part either in the holy month of Ramadan or in the recent incidents in the region as well as in the violence which followed in May. 
                    
                    The current wave of attacks started with spear-phishing Arabic-listed emails carrying PDF files embedded in a geofenced malicious URL that can only selectively route victims to the password-protected file if the source IP address of these files is in the targeted Middle East nations. 
                    
                    The beneficiaries outside of the target Group are relocated to benign websites like Al Akhbar (www.al-akhbar.com) and Al Jazeera (www.aljazeera.net), generally Arabic language news websites. 
                    
                    The last step on the infection chain entailed an extraction of the archive to drop a customized implant named LastConn, which is a new version or upgrade of a backdoor called SharpStages that was revealed in December 2020 by Cybereason researcher, as Molerats espionage campaign targeting the Middle East. 
                    
                    The LastConn is executed with a Decoy document, the malware relies largely on Dropbox API for downloading and executing cloud-hosted files in addition to arbitrary instructions and screenshots that are then returned to Dropbox. 
                    
                    The continually expanding toolkit of TA402 emphasizes that the Group continues to develop and adapt tailored malware implants to sneak up past defenses and detect thwarts. 
                    
                    "TA402 is a highly effective and capable threat actor that remains a serious threat, especially to entities operating in and working with government or other geopolitical entities in the Middle East," the researchers concluded. "It is likely TA402 continues its targeting largely focused on the Middle East region."                     </p>

                <h2>Malware Sload Aiming Europe Again #10</h2>
                <p>Sload (also termed as Starslord loader) has proven to be one of the most destructive malware variants in recent years. It usually acts as a downloader, which is a computer virus that accumulates and exfiltrates data from an infected system in order to analyze the target and drop a more significant payload if the target is profitable. 

                    Sload has been active in Europe since at least 2018, with numerous vendors reporting assaults on targets in the United Kingdom and Italy. Instead of employing an executable or a malicious document to invade devices, the malware's developers have chosen to use scripts that are intrinsic to Windows operating systems such as VBS and PowerShell as an initial foothold, tricking users into executing them using spear phishing. 
                    
                    The downloader is undergoing development and has gone through several iterations; the creator is continuously changing the first stage script but the main module remains basically unchanged. 
                    
                    According to early reports, this virus downloads a PowerShell script, which then downloads and executes Sload, using a rogue LNK file (Windows shortcut). Later editions start with obfuscated WSF/VBS scripts that are frequently mutated to avoid detection by anti-virus software. The initial script used in attacks has a low VirusTotal score and is meant to get beyond complex security technologies like EDRs. 
                    
                    This year, Minerva Labs has noticed Sload infections arriving from Italian endpoints. The script they found is an obfuscated WSF script that decodes a sequence of malicious commands and then secretly downloads and runs a remote payload in memory after being executed. 
                    
                    The script does this by renaming legal Windows binaries, which is a straightforward evasion method. Both "bitsadmin.exe" and "Powershell.exe" are copied and renamed, with the former being used to download a malicious PowerShell script and the latter loading it into memory and executing it. 
                    
                    The downloader's final payload varies, but it has been known to drop the Ramnit and Trickbot banking trojans, both of which are extremely dangerous malware that can lead to ransomware attacks. </p>

                <h2>NATO's Cloud Platform Hacked #9</h2>
                <p>The SOA & IdM platform is utilized by NATO and is classified as secret. It was used to conduct various critical functions inside the Polaris programme. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), commonly known as the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance made up of 30 European and North American countries. 

                    The organization is responsible for carrying out the North Atlantic Treaty, which was signed on April 04, 1949. NATO is a collective defense organization in which NATO's independent member states commit to defending each other in the event of an external attack. NATO's headquarters are in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, and Allied Command Operations' headquarters is near Mons, Belgium. 
                    
                    Polaris was developed as part of NATO's IT modernization effort and uses the SOA & IdM platform to provide centralized security, integration, and hosting information management. The military alliance classified the platform as a secret because it performs multiple key roles. 
                    
                    According to the hackers, they used a backdoor to make copies of the data on this platform and attempted to blackmail Everis. They went even further, making jokes about handing over the stolen material to Russian intelligence. 
                    
                    Paul Howland, Polaris Program Officer explained the benefits of the program: “This project has the potential to be a game-changer in how NATO will develop and deploy its operational services in the future. It will drive innovation and reduce costs. Operational by ensuring a much greater reuse of deployed capacities". The hackers who carried out the attack said they had no idea they could take advantage of a flaw in the NATO platform at first. Furthermore, they concentrated solely on Everis' corporate data in Latin America, despite NATO's announcement that it was ready to respond to a cyber-attack. One of the secure NATO systems was among Everis' subsidiaries, much to their astonishment. 

                    After analyzing the company and discovering documents connected to drones and military defense systems, the hackers continued stealing more data from Everis networks. They justified their actions by claiming that they were not "for peace on earth and in the cyber world" when they slowed the development of the Polaris programme. The hackers sought a ransom of XMR 14,500 from Everis in exchange for not linking the company's identity to the LATAM Airlines data breach. They've also demanded this money in exchange for not revealing any NATO data.  </p>

                <h2>NSA Funds Development & Release of D3FEND Framework #8</h2>
                <p>The framework, now available through MITRE, provides countermeasures to attacks. D3FEND, a framework for cybersecurity professionals to tailor defenses against specific cyber threats is now available through MITRE.  NSA funded MITRE’s research for D3FEND to improve the cybersecurity of National Security Systems, the Department of Defense, and the Defense Industrial Base. The D3FEND technical knowledge base of defensive countermeasures for common offensive techniques is complementary to MITRE’s ATT&CK, a knowledge base of cyber adversary behavior.

                    D3FEND establishes terminology of computer network defensive techniques and illuminates previously-unspecified relationships between defensive and offensive methods. This framework illustrates the complex interplay between computer network architectures, threats, and cyber countermeasures.
                    
                    MITRE released D3FEND as a complement to its existing ATT&CK framework, a free, globally-accessible knowledge base of cyber adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. Industry and government use ATT&CK as a foundation to develop specific cyber threat models and methodologies. Complementary to the threat-based ATT&CK model, D3FEND provides a model of ways to counter common offensive techniques, enumerating how defensive techniques impact an actor’s ability to succeed. By framing computer network defender complexity of countermeasure functions and techniques as granularly as ATT&CK frames computer network attacker techniques, D3FEND enables cybersecurity professionals to tailor defenses against specific cyber threats, thereby reducing a system’s potential attack surface. As a result, D3FEND will drive more effective design, deployment, and defense of networked systems writ large.

                    Frameworks such as ATT&CK and D3FEND provide mission-agnostic tools for industry and government to conduct analyses and communicate findings. Whether categorizing adversary behavior or detailing how defensive capabilities mitigate threats, frameworks provide common descriptions that empower information sharing and operational collaboration for an ever-evolving cyber landscape.
                    
                    NSA and MITRE encourage the cybersecurity community to promote the adoption of this vocabulary by cybersecurity professionals across government, industry, and academia. Cybersecurity professionals can provide comments to improve and add to the framework by contacting the MITRE D3FEND team at https://d3fend.mitre.org.   </p>

                <h2>Iranian News Websites Replaced with 'U.S. Seizure' Message #7</h2>
                <p>Several Iran-linked news websites appear to be down, but the U.S. government hasn't given an official statement.
                    The websites for Press TV, Iran's state-run, English-language news outlet, as well as Al-Alam, another Iranian news outlet, and a number of other websites were replaced with messages that said their websites had been seized by the U.S. government Tuesday.

"This website has been seized," a notice currently on the Press TV website reads.

The U.S. government has not publicly acknowledged the operation, but CNN reported that a U.S. official said the government had seized the sites because they are linked to what the U.S. says are disinformation efforts. The notice adds that the domain was allegedly seized as part of a law enforcement action carried out by the Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Export Enforcement, and Federal Bureau of Investigation. Motherboard has not confirmed that this was a U.S. government action; Press TV wrote on another one of its domains that "Message on websites of Iranian, regional TVs claims ‘domain seizure by US govt.’"

"In what seems to be a coordinated action, a similar message has appeared on the websites of a series of Iranian and regional television networks that claims their domains have been 'seized by the United States Government,'" Press TV wrote. The post then pointed to a series of alternative domains users can visit to view the Press TV site; at least one of those did not work at the time of writing.

On Twitter, journalist Laura Rozen said that State Department spokesperson Ned Price said he did not have anything to say on the alleged seizure, but said he thinks the Department of Justice may have something to provide shortly.

The Department of Justice has not yet announced any operation against the sites. Authorities also seized Almasirah, a Yemeni English-language news site, according to another seizure notice on that site, as well as kataibhezbollah.org, almaalomah.org, and kafmedia.net, news sites with alleged ties to Iran.

The FBI did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did the Department of Commerce.

The Associated Press reported that Iran blamed the U.S. government for the website seizures, but that U.S. officials did not acknowledge the move. </p>

                <h2>Wormable DarkRadiation Ransomware Targets Linux and Docker Instances #6</h2>
                <p>Cybersecurity researchers are sounding the alarm bell over a new ransomware strain called "DarkRadiation" that's implemented entirely in Bash and targets Linux and Docker cloud containers, while banking on messaging service Telegram for command-and-control (C2) communications.

                    "The ransomware is written in Bash script and targets Red Hat/CentOS and Debian Linux distributions," researchers from Trend Micro said in a report published last week. "The malware uses OpenSSL's AES algorithm with CBC mode to encrypt files in various directories. It also uses Telegram's API to send an infection status to the threat actor(s)."
                    
                    As of writing, there's no information available on the delivery methods or evidence that the ransomware has been deployed in real-world attacks.
                    
                    The findings come from an analysis of a collection of hacking tools hosted on the unidentified threat actor's infrastructure (IP address "185.141.25.168") in a directory called "api_attack." The toolset was first noticed by Twitter user @r3dbU7z on May 28.
                    
                    DarkRadiation's infection chain involves a multi-stage attack process and is noteworthy for its extensive reliance on Bash scripts to retrieve the malware and encrypt the files as well as Telegram API to communicate with the C2 server via hardcoded API keys. 
                    Said to be under active development, the ransomware leverages obfuscation tactics to scramble the Bash script using an open-source tool called "node-bash-obfuscate" to split the code into multiple chunks, followed by assigning a variable name to each segment and replacing the original script with variable references.

                    Upon execution, DarkRadiation checks if it's run as the root user, and if so, uses the elevated permissions to download and install Wget, cURL, and OpenSSL libraries, and takes a periodic snapshot of the users that are currently logged into a Unix computer system using the "who" command every five seconds, the results of which are then exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server using the Telegram API.
                    
                    "If any of these are not available on the infected device, the malware attempts to download the required tools using YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified), a python-based package manager widely adopted by popular Linux distros such as RedHat and CentOS," SentinelOne researchers explained in a parallel write-up of DarkRadiation published Monday.
                    
                    The ransomware, in its final phase of the infection, retrieves a list of all available users on the compromised system, overwrites existing user passwords with "megapassword," and deletes all shell users, but not before creating a new user with the username "ferrum" and password "MegPw0rD3" to proceed with the encryption process. Interestingly, SentinelOne's analysis reveals different variations wherein the password for the user "ferrum" is downloaded from the attacker's C2 server in few versions, while in others, it is hardcoded with strings such as "$MeGaPass123#," implying that the malware is undergoing rapid changes prior to actual deployment.

                    "It must be noted that the ransomware appends radioactive symbols ('.☢') as a file extension for an encrypted file," Trend Micro threat researcher Aliakbar Zahravi said.
                    
                    A second moving part associated with the attack is an SSH worm that's engineered to receive a credential configuration in the form of a base64-encoded parameter that's used to connect to the target system using the SSH protocol, and eventually download and execute the ransomware.
                    
                    In addition to reporting the execution status, along with the encryption key, back to the adversary's Telegram channel through the API, DarkRadiation also comes with capabilities to stop and disable all running Docker containers on the infected machine, after which a ransom note is displayed to the user.
                    
                    "Malware written in shell script languages allows attackers to be more versatile and to avoid some common detection methods," SentinelOne researchers said.
                    
                    "As scripts do not need to be recompiled, they can be iterated upon more rapidly. Moreover, since some security software relies on static file signatures, these can easily be evaded through rapid iteration and the use of simple obfuscator tools to generate completely different script files." </p>

                <h2>North Korea Exploited VPN Flaw to Hack South's Nuclear Research Institute #5</h2>
                <p>LSouth Korea's state-run Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) on Friday disclosed that its internal network was infiltrated by suspected attackers operating out of its northern counterpart.

                    The intrusion is said to have taken place on May 14 through a vulnerability in an unnamed virtual private network (VPN) vendor and involved a total of 13 IP addresses, one of which — "27.102.114[.]89" — has been previously linked to a state-sponsored threat actor dubbed Kimsuky.
                    
                    KAERI, established in 1959 and situated in the city of Daejeon, is a government-funded research institute that designs and develops nuclear technologies related to reactors, fuel rods, radiation fusion, and nuclear safety.
                    
                    Following the intrusion, the think tank said it took steps to block the attacker's IP addresses in question and applied necessary security patches to the vulnerable VPN solution. "Currently, the Atomic Energy Research Institute is investigating the subject of the hacking and the amount of damage," the entity said in a statement.
                    
                    The development comes following a report from SISA Journal, which disclosed the breach, alleging that the agency was attempting to cover up the hack by denying such an incident took place. KAERI attributed it to a "mistake in the response of the working-level staff." Active since 2012, Kimsuky (aka Velvet Chollima, Black Banshee, or Thallium) is a North Korean threat actor known for its cyber espionage campaigns targeting think tanks and nuclear power operators in South Korea.

                    Earlier this month, cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes disclosed a wave of attacks undertaken by the adversary to strike high-profile government officials in the country by installing an Android and Windows backdoor called AppleSeed for amassing valuable information.
                    
                    The targeted entities involved the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador of the Embassy of Sri Lanka to the State, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Nuclear Security Officer, and the Deputy Consul General at Korean Consulate General in Hong Kong, with the aforementioned IP address used for command-and-control (C2) communications.
                    
                    It is not immediately clear what VPN vulnerability was exploited to breach the network. But it's worth noting that unpatched VPN systems from Pulse Secure, SonicWall, Fortinet FortiOS, and Citrix have been subjected to attacks by multiple threat actors in recent years.</p>

                <p>A string of cyber espionage campaigns dating all the way back to 2014 and focused on gathering military intelligence from neighbouring countries have been linked to a Chinese military-intelligence apparatus.

                    In a wide-ranging report published by Massachusetts-headquartered Recorded Future this week, the cybersecurity firm's Insikt Group said it identified ties between a group it tracks as "RedFoxtrot" to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Unit 69010 operating out of Ürümqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the country.
                    
                    Previously called the Lanzhou Military Region's Second Technical Reconnaissance Bureau, Unit 69010 is a military cover for a Technical Reconnaissance Bureau (TRB) within China's Strategic Support Force (SSF) Network Systems Department (NSD). The connection to PLA Unit 69010 stems from what the researchers said were "lax operational security measures" adopted by an unnamed suspected RedFoxtrot threat actor, whose online persona disclosed the physical address of the reconnaissance bureau and has had a history of affiliating with the PLA's former Communications Command Academy in Wuhan.

                    RedFoxtrot is noted to target government, defense, and telecommunications sectors across Central Asia, India, and Pakistan, with intrusions in the last six months directed against three Indian aerospace and defense contractors as well as major telecommunications providers and government agencies in Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, and Pakistan.
                    
                    "Activity over this period showed a particular focus on Indian targets, which occurred at a time of heightened border tensions between India and the People's Republic of China," the researchers said.
                    
                    Attacks staged by the adversary involved an assortment of open- and closed-source tools that have been shared across Chinese cyber espionage groups, including PlugX, Royal Road RTF weaponizer, QUICKHEAL, PCShare, IceFog, and Poison Ivy RAT.
                    
                    Also observed is the use of AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE infrastructure, which encompasses a modular Windows backdoor called ShadowPad that has been previously attributed to APT41 and subsequently shared between other Chinese state-backed actors. Furthermore, domains registered by RedFoxtrot — "inbsnl.ddns[.]info" and "adtl.mywire[.]org" — suggest that the threat actor may have set its sights on Indian telecom service provider Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and a Bengaluru-based company called Alpha Design Technologies Limited (ADTL) that specializes in research and development of missile, radar, and satellite systems.

                    The development comes more than three months after another China-linked threat group, dubbed RedEcho, was uncovered targeting India's power grid, including a power plant run by National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Limited and New Delhi-based Power System Operation Corporation Limited.</p>

                <h2>Russia bans VyprVPN, Opera VPN services for not complying with blacklist request #3</h2>
                <p>Russia's telecommunications and media regulator Roskomnadzor (RKN) on Thursday introduced restrictions on the operation of VyprVPN and Opera VPN services in the country.

                    "In accordance with the regulation on responding to threats to circumvent restrictions on access to child pornography, suicidal, pro-narcotic and other prohibited content, restrictions on the use of VPN services VyprVPN and Opera VPN will be introduced from June 17, 2021," the state agency said in a statement.
                    
                    The watchdog described them as threats in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 127 dated February 12, adding the restrictions will not affect Russian companies using VPN services in continuous technological processes. The development comes a little over a month after RKN sent a request to enterprises and organizations that use the two VPN services to inform the Center for Monitoring and Management of the Public Telecommunications Network and seek exceptions so as to avoid disruptions to their business operations.

                    The agency said more than 200 technological processes associated with 130 Russian companies are included in the "white lists."
                    
                    On March 28, 2019, the Russian government required VPNs, anonymizers, and search engine operators to ensure that they block sites included on Roskomnadzor's regularly updated register of banned sites through the Federal State Information System (FSIS).
                    
                    To that effect, ten providers of virtual private network (VPN) servers — including NordVPN, Hide My Ass (HMA), Hola VPN, OpenVPN, VyprVPN, ExpressVPN, TorGuard, IPVanish, Kaspersky Secure Connection, and VPN Unlimited — were mandated to connect to the national blocklist.
                    
                    According to Russian news agency Interfax, Kaspersky Lab was the only company that complied with the request. Avast, another cybersecurity vendor, exited the VPN market following the order.</p>

                <h2>Fugitive Anonymous Hacker ‘Commander X’ Arrested #2</h2>
                <p>Fugitive hacker Christopher Doyon, or Commander X, was captured in Mexico and has been extradited to the United States, where he will face decade-old hacking charges. Doyon was a member of the Anonymous hacktivist collective. 

                    According to an indictment, Doyon was part of a series of coordinated cyber attacks following a protest in Santa Cruz, California in 2010. Demonstrators occupied the front steps of the Santa Cruz Courthouses for approximately two months, from July 4 to October 2, 2010,  to protest the county’s law against camping that directly impacted people experiencing homelessness in the city. 
                    
                    Doyon later allegedly shut down the Santa Cruz County website in a DDoS, or distributed denial of service attack, in a coordinated effort with the People’s Liberation Front and Anonymous. According to the indictment, they flooded the network with external communications requests so “the target could not respond to legitimate traffic, or responded so slowly as to render the target effectively unavailable.” “In retribution for Santa Cruz City’s enforcement of [the anti-camping law], the PLF coordinated and executed a DDoS attack against Santa Cruz County’s computer servers,” the indictment said. “The PLF referred to these co-ordinated attacks on Santa Cruz County as ‘Operation Peace Camp 2010.’”

                    He is also being charged for conspiracy to commit intentional damage to a protected computer, committing intentional damage to a protected computer, and aiding and abetting. The documents also named Joshua John Covelli, or “Absolem” or “Toxic,” as a co-conspirator.
                    
                    In addition to hacking charges, Doyon is also facing charges for failing to appear in court. At the time, his counsel reported that he had fled to Canada. He continued to hack for years, according to a book he published about hacking while a fugitive.
                    
                    Doyon was a fugitive in Mexico for nearly a decade after working with the PLF and later on was a high ranking member in the hacktivist group Anonymous during their most active years.
                    
                    Doyon has spoken extensively about his time as a fugitive and the charges he faces. “No servers were breached, no data was stolen. It’s a small, crowdsourced act of civil disobedience,” he said in 2017. “It’s unjust to take that many years away from me for protest … from my perspective, I’m in political exile. But according to the U.S. Department of Justice, I’m a fugitive.”

                    A crowdfunding campaign set up by friends of Doyon earlier this month calls him a “political refugee.”
                    
                    “We are a group of Mexican citizens and friends of Commander X, who support him in his exile,” the crowdfunding campaign states. “We know it is difficult times for all of us, but he’s a political refugee and needs us all right now. We’d love to give back a little of what he’s given us all. We’ve provided housing for him and his two beautiful dogs. A nice, safe place with fields and mountains. Now we have to deal with medical and that's where you come in.”  </p>

                <h2>Credit Card Hacking Forum Gets Hacked, Exposing 300,000 Hackers’ Accounts #1</h2>
                <p>Carding Mafia, a forum for stealing and trading credit cards has been hacked, exposing almost 300,000 user accounts, according to data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned.

                    The data breach allegedly exposed the email addresses, IP addresses, usernames, and hashed passwords of 297,744 users. Have I Been Pwned announced the data breach on Tuesday, saying the breach happened last week. 
                    
                    On the Carding Mafia forum and its public Telegram channel, however, there was no sign that its users have been warned. Carding Mafia has more than 500,000 users, according to the forum's own statistics. The site administrator did not immediately respond to an email asking for comment. 
                    
                    Troy Hunt, the founder of Have I Been Pwned, told Motherboard that he was able to confirm the hacked database is legitimate. Hunt said that he noticed in the database that there were Mailinator email addresses, a service that allows anyone to create throwaway email addresses. Hunt said that he then inserted those addresses in the forum, using the Forgot Password feature, and he saw that those emails are recognized as valid emails. Usually Mailinator email addresses are created for one purpose and are not reused; the fact that these addresses are contained in the data dump and are also recognized by the forum suggests that the data is legitimate. Motherboard can confirm that the forum says "you have not entered an email address that we recognize" when trying to use the Forgot Password feature with an email that we have not used to register on the forum. 

                    "Another 'hacker hacking hackers' story," Hunt said.  
                    
                    Motherboard has not seen the data, and we are unable to independently confirm the breach. 
                    
                    On another hacking forum, a user was advertising the data allegedly stolen from Carding Mafia on January 27 of this year. This is the latest example of forums that cater to hackers or cybercriminals getting hacked. In 2017, hackers stole the database of a hacking forum called Darkode right after it opened. The infamous OGUSERS forum, where people traded stolen Instagram and other social media accounts, has been hacked twice, in 2019, and 2020. More recently, security journalist Brian Krebs reported that three of the most important Russian-language cybercrime forums have been hacked over the span of three weeks. 

                    In all of these cases, the hacked user information can be used to link pseudonymous users across different forums. Law enforcement agencies could also use the stolen data to try to identify criminals hiding behind those nicknames.</p>
