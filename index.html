                <h2>McAfee founder found dead in Barcenlona prison #16</h2>
                <p>John McAfee has been found dead in mysterious circumstances inside a prison cell in Barcelona, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pais, the developer and programmer of one of the first and most popular commercial antivirus tools, and the founder of cybersecurity firm McAfee.
                    John McAfee was awaiting extradition to the United States after the Spanish court today approved his extradition request, and the US Department of Justice indicted him for tax evasion and fraud, and he was arrested by Spanish police at El Prat Airport in October while trying to travel to Turkey.
                    John McAfee founded and ran software company McAfee Associates from 1987 to 1994, where he created McAfees's first commercial antivirus software, then quit the company and founded dozens of other companies, repeatedly causing controversy with statements he made on his Twitter account.
                    The Department of Justice said that McAfee did not pay taxes on millions of dollars earned through the cryptocurrency system and defrauded the institution's investors.
                    In his last message posted on his Twitter account on June 16, "by the lawyer or one of his associates," McAfee continued to deny the charges against him writing:
                    "The US believes I have hidden crypto. I wish I did but it has dissolved through the many hands of Team McAfee (your belief is not required), and my remaining assets are all seized. My friends evaporated through fear of association.
                    I have nothing. Yet, I regret nothing.".

                <h2>ADATA suffers 700 GB data leak in Ragnar Locker ransomware attack #14</h2>
                <p>The Ragnar Locker ransomware gang have published download links for more than 700GB of archived data stolen from Taiwanese memory and storage chip maker ADATA.

                    A set of 13 archives, allegedly containing sensitive ADATA files, have been publicly available at a cloud-based storage service, at least for some time. On Saturday, the ransomware actor published on their leak site the download links to a new set of ADATA corporate documents, warning interested parties that the links would not survive for long.

                    Ragnar Locker’s premonition proved true as MEGA storage service, where the gang chose to host the illegally obtained data, reacted and closed the threat actor’s account, denying access to any files they had shared publicly.
                    
                    Two of the leaked archives are quite large, weighing over 100GB, but several of them that could have been easily downloaded are less than 1.1GB large.
                    
                    Per the file metadata published by the threat actor, the largest archive is close to 300GB and its name gives no clue about what it might contain. Another large one is 117GB in size and its name is just as nondescript as in the case of the first one (Archive#2). Judging by the names of the archives, Ragnar Locker likely stole from ADATA documents containing financial information, non-disclosure agreements, among other type of details.

                    The ransomware attack on ADATA happened on May 23rd, 2021, forcing them to take systems offline. As the Ragnar Locker leak clearly shows, ADATA did not pay the ransom and restored the affected systems on its own.

                    The ransomware actor claims stealing 1.5TB of sensitive files before deploying the encryption routine, saying that they took their time in the process because of the poor network defenses.
                    
                    “So then, as usual, we did offer to cooperate to fix the vulnerabilities and to restore their system and of course, avoid any publication regarding this issue, however, they didn't value much their own private information, as well as partners/clients/employees/customers information” - Ragnar Locker
                    
                    The recently leaked batch of archives is the second one that Ragnar Locker ransomware publishes for ADATA. The previous one was posted earlier this month and includes four small 7-zip archives (less than 250MB together) that can still be downloaded.</p>

                <h2>Patch Tor Browser Bug to Prevent Tracking of Your Online Activities #13</h2>
                <p>Open-source Tor browser has been updated to version 10.0.18 with fixes for multiple issues, including a privacy-defeating bug that could be used to uniquely fingerprint users across different browsers based on the apps installed on a computer.

                    In addition to updating Tor to 0.4.5.9, the browser's Android version has been upgraded to Firefox to version 89.1.1, alongside incorporating patches rolled out by Mozilla for several security vulnerabilities addressed in Firefox 89.
                    
                    Chief among the rectified issues is a new fingerprinting attack that came to light last month. Dubbed scheme flooding, the vulnerability enables a malicious website to leverage information about installed apps on the system to assign users a permanent unique identifier even when they switch browsers, use incognito mode, or a VPN.
                    
                    Put differently, the weakness takes advantage of custom URL schemes in apps as an attack vector, allowing a bad actor to track a device's user between different browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and even Tor, effectively circumventing cross-browser anonymity protections on Windows, Linux, and macOS. "A website exploiting the scheme flooding vulnerability could create a stable and unique identifier that can link those browsing identities together," FingerprintJS researcher Konstantin Darutkin said.

                    Currently, the attack checks a list of 24 installed applications that consists of Adobe, Battle.net, Discord, Epic Games, ExpressVPN, Facebook Messenger, Figma, Hotspot Shield, iTunes, Microsoft Word, NordVPN, Notion, Postman, Sketch, Skype, Slack, Spotify, Steam, TeamViewer, Telegram, Visual Studio Code, Xcode, WhatsApp, and Zoom.
                    
                    The issue has serious implications for privacy as it could be exploited by adversaries to unmask Tor users by correlating their browsing activities as they switch to a non-anonymizing browser, such as Google Chrome. To counter the attack, Tor now sets the "network.protocol-handler.external" to false so as to block the browser from probing installed apps.
                    
                    Of the other three browsers, while Google Chrome features built-in safeguards against scheme flooding — it prevents launching any application unless it's triggered by a user gesture, like a mouse click — the browser's PDF Viewer was found to bypass this mitigation.
                    
                    "Until this vulnerability is fixed, the only way to have private browsing sessions not associated with your primary device is to use another device altogether," Darutkin said. Tor browser users are recommended to move quickly to apply the update to ensure they are protected.
                    
                    The development arrives little over a week after encrypted messaging service Wire addressed two critical vulnerabilities in its iOS and web app that could lead to a denial-of-service (CVE-2021-32666) and permit an attacker to take control of a user account (CVE-2021-32683). </p>

                <h2>Audi And Volkswagen's Data Breach Affected 3.3 Million Customers #12</h2>
                <p>Volkswagen announced that a massive data breach exposed the personal information of over 3.3 million customers after one of its vendors left a cache of customer data unencrypted on the internet. In a letter to customers, Volkswagen said that the vendor utilized by Volkswagen, its subsidiary Audi, and authorized dealers in the United States and Canada had left customer data from 2014 to 2019 unsecured for two years between August 2019 and May 2021. 

                    Personal information about clients and potential buyers were included in the data, which was collected for sales and marketing purposes. Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. (VWGoA) is the German Volkswagen Group's North American subsidiary, responsible for Volkswagen, Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, and VW Credit, Inc. operations in the United States and Canada. 
                    
                    Between August 2019 and May 2021, a vendor left insecure data accessible on the Internet, according to data breach notices submitted with the California and Maine Attorney General's offices. This specific vendor informed the VWGoA in March that an unauthorized person had gained access to the data and may have accessed customer information for Audi, Volkswagen, and some authorized dealers. 
                    
                    According to VWGoA authorities, the hack affected 3.3 million customers, with almost 97% of those affected being Audi customers or potential buyers. The data breach appears to have exposed information ranging from contact information to more sensitive data including social security numbers and loan numbers. 
                    
                    "The data included some or all of the following contact information about you: first and last name, personal or business mailing address, email address, or phone number. In some instances, the data also included information about a vehicle purchased, leased, or inquired about, such as the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), make, model, year, color, and trim packages," disclosed VWGoA in a data breach notification. 
                    
                    "The data also included more sensitive information relating to eligibility for purchase, loan, or lease. More than 95% of the sensitive data included was driver’s license numbers. There were also a very small number of dates of birth, Social Security or social insurance numbers, account or loan numbers, and tax identification numbers." The hackers are demanding between $4,000 and $5,000 for all of the records, claiming that the database contains no social security numbers. The threat actors earlier stated that the database for a VPN service provider with various Android apps on the Google Play Store was on sale for $1,000. 

                    Volkswagen is offering free credit protection and monitoring services to the 90,000 customers whose personal information was exposed, as well as $1 million in identity theft insurance.  </p>

                <h2>Latest Campaign by Molerats Hackers Target Middle Eastern Governments #11</h2>
                <p>After two months of break, a Middle Eastern advanced persistent-threat (APT) organization has resurfaced and is targeting government institutions in the Middle East -- global government bodies affiliated with geopolitics as a part of its recent malicious activities. 

                    Proofpoint, a company headquartered in Sunnyvale, ascribed this action to a politically motivated threat actor tracked as TA402, colloquially known as Molerats or GazaHackerTeam. 
                    
                    TA402 is supposed to work for objectives that are consistent with military or Palestinian state goals. The threat actor has been operating for a decade with a history of compromising associations mainly in Israel and Palestine. The attacks covered verticals such as technology, telecoms, finance, the academy, the army, the media, and governments. 
                    
                    The two months' break in the operation is not apparent, but the Proofpoint researchers have suggested that it could have played a part either in the holy month of Ramadan or in the recent incidents in the region as well as in the violence which followed in May. 
                    
                    The current wave of attacks started with spear-phishing Arabic-listed emails carrying PDF files embedded in a geofenced malicious URL that can only selectively route victims to the password-protected file if the source IP address of these files is in the targeted Middle East nations. 
                    
                    The beneficiaries outside of the target Group are relocated to benign websites like Al Akhbar (www.al-akhbar.com) and Al Jazeera (www.aljazeera.net), generally Arabic language news websites. 
                    
                    The last step on the infection chain entailed an extraction of the archive to drop a customized implant named LastConn, which is a new version or upgrade of a backdoor called SharpStages that was revealed in December 2020 by Cybereason researcher, as Molerats espionage campaign targeting the Middle East. 
                    
                    The LastConn is executed with a Decoy document, the malware relies largely on Dropbox API for downloading and executing cloud-hosted files in addition to arbitrary instructions and screenshots that are then returned to Dropbox. 
                    
                    The continually expanding toolkit of TA402 emphasizes that the Group continues to develop and adapt tailored malware implants to sneak up past defenses and detect thwarts. 
                    
                    "TA402 is a highly effective and capable threat actor that remains a serious threat, especially to entities operating in and working with government or other geopolitical entities in the Middle East," the researchers concluded. "It is likely TA402 continues its targeting largely focused on the Middle East region."                     </p>

                <h2>Malware Sload Aiming Europe Again #10</h2>
                <p>Sload (also termed as Starslord loader) has proven to be one of the most destructive malware variants in recent years. It usually acts as a downloader, which is a computer virus that accumulates and exfiltrates data from an infected system in order to analyze the target and drop a more significant payload if the target is profitable. 

                    Sload has been active in Europe since at least 2018, with numerous vendors reporting assaults on targets in the United Kingdom and Italy. Instead of employing an executable or a malicious document to invade devices, the malware's developers have chosen to use scripts that are intrinsic to Windows operating systems such as VBS and PowerShell as an initial foothold, tricking users into executing them using spear phishing. 
                    
                    The downloader is undergoing development and has gone through several iterations; the creator is continuously changing the first stage script but the main module remains basically unchanged. 
                    
                    According to early reports, this virus downloads a PowerShell script, which then downloads and executes Sload, using a rogue LNK file (Windows shortcut). Later editions start with obfuscated WSF/VBS scripts that are frequently mutated to avoid detection by anti-virus software. The initial script used in attacks has a low VirusTotal score and is meant to get beyond complex security technologies like EDRs. 
                    
                    This year, Minerva Labs has noticed Sload infections arriving from Italian endpoints. The script they found is an obfuscated WSF script that decodes a sequence of malicious commands and then secretly downloads and runs a remote payload in memory after being executed. 
                    
                    The script does this by renaming legal Windows binaries, which is a straightforward evasion method. Both "bitsadmin.exe" and "Powershell.exe" are copied and renamed, with the former being used to download a malicious PowerShell script and the latter loading it into memory and executing it. 
                    
                    The downloader's final payload varies, but it has been known to drop the Ramnit and Trickbot banking trojans, both of which are extremely dangerous malware that can lead to ransomware attacks. </p>

                <h2>NATO's Cloud Platform Hacked #9</h2>
                <p>The SOA & IdM platform is utilized by NATO and is classified as secret. It was used to conduct various critical functions inside the Polaris programme. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), commonly known as the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance made up of 30 European and North American countries. 

                    The organization is responsible for carrying out the North Atlantic Treaty, which was signed on April 04, 1949. NATO is a collective defense organization in which NATO's independent member states commit to defending each other in the event of an external attack. NATO's headquarters are in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, and Allied Command Operations' headquarters is near Mons, Belgium. 
                    
                    Polaris was developed as part of NATO's IT modernization effort and uses the SOA & IdM platform to provide centralized security, integration, and hosting information management. The military alliance classified the platform as a secret because it performs multiple key roles. 
                    
                    According to the hackers, they used a backdoor to make copies of the data on this platform and attempted to blackmail Everis. They went even further, making jokes about handing over the stolen material to Russian intelligence. 
                    
                    Paul Howland, Polaris Program Officer explained the benefits of the program: “This project has the potential to be a game-changer in how NATO will develop and deploy its operational services in the future. It will drive innovation and reduce costs. Operational by ensuring a much greater reuse of deployed capacities". The hackers who carried out the attack said they had no idea they could take advantage of a flaw in the NATO platform at first. Furthermore, they concentrated solely on Everis' corporate data in Latin America, despite NATO's announcement that it was ready to respond to a cyber-attack. One of the secure NATO systems was among Everis' subsidiaries, much to their astonishment. 

                    After analyzing the company and discovering documents connected to drones and military defense systems, the hackers continued stealing more data from Everis networks. They justified their actions by claiming that they were not "for peace on earth and in the cyber world" when they slowed the development of the Polaris programme. The hackers sought a ransom of XMR 14,500 from Everis in exchange for not linking the company's identity to the LATAM Airlines data breach. They've also demanded this money in exchange for not revealing any NATO data.  </p>

                <p>The framework, now available through MITRE, provides countermeasures to attacks. D3FEND, a framework for cybersecurity professionals to tailor defenses against specific cyber threats is now available through MITRE.  NSA funded MITRE’s research for D3FEND to improve the cybersecurity of National Security Systems, the Department of Defense, and the Defense Industrial Base. The D3FEND technical knowledge base of defensive countermeasures for common offensive techniques is complementary to MITRE’s ATT&CK, a knowledge base of cyber adversary behavior.

                    D3FEND establishes terminology of computer network defensive techniques and illuminates previously-unspecified relationships between defensive and offensive methods. This framework illustrates the complex interplay between computer network architectures, threats, and cyber countermeasures.
                    
                    MITRE released D3FEND as a complement to its existing ATT&CK framework, a free, globally-accessible knowledge base of cyber adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. Industry and government use ATT&CK as a foundation to develop specific cyber threat models and methodologies. Complementary to the threat-based ATT&CK model, D3FEND provides a model of ways to counter common offensive techniques, enumerating how defensive techniques impact an actor’s ability to succeed. By framing computer network defender complexity of countermeasure functions and techniques as granularly as ATT&CK frames computer network attacker techniques, D3FEND enables cybersecurity professionals to tailor defenses against specific cyber threats, thereby reducing a system’s potential attack surface. As a result, D3FEND will drive more effective design, deployment, and defense of networked systems writ large.

                    Frameworks such as ATT&CK and D3FEND provide mission-agnostic tools for industry and government to conduct analyses and communicate findings. Whether categorizing adversary behavior or detailing how defensive capabilities mitigate threats, frameworks provide common descriptions that empower information sharing and operational collaboration for an ever-evolving cyber landscape.
                    
                    NSA and MITRE encourage the cybersecurity community to promote the adoption of this vocabulary by cybersecurity professionals across government, industry, and academia. Cybersecurity professionals can provide comments to improve and add to the framework by contacting the MITRE D3FEND team at https://d3fend.mitre.org.   </p>

                <h2>Iranian News Websites Replaced with 'U.S. Seizure' Message #7</h2>
                <p>Several Iran-linked news websites appear to be down, but the U.S. government hasn't given an official statement.
                    The websites for Press TV, Iran's state-run, English-language news outlet, as well as Al-Alam, another Iranian news outlet, and a number of other websites were replaced with messages that said their websites had been seized by the U.S. government Tuesday.

"This website has been seized," a notice currently on the Press TV website reads.

The U.S. government has not publicly acknowledged the operation, but CNN reported that a U.S. official said the government had seized the sites because they are linked to what the U.S. says are disinformation efforts. The notice adds that the domain was allegedly seized as part of a law enforcement action carried out by the Bureau of Industry and Security, Office of Export Enforcement, and Federal Bureau of Investigation. Motherboard has not confirmed that this was a U.S. government action; Press TV wrote on another one of its domains that "Message on websites of Iranian, regional TVs claims ‘domain seizure by US govt.’"

"In what seems to be a coordinated action, a similar message has appeared on the websites of a series of Iranian and regional television networks that claims their domains have been 'seized by the United States Government,'" Press TV wrote. The post then pointed to a series of alternative domains users can visit to view the Press TV site; at least one of those did not work at the time of writing.

On Twitter, journalist Laura Rozen said that State Department spokesperson Ned Price said he did not have anything to say on the alleged seizure, but said he thinks the Department of Justice may have something to provide shortly.

The Department of Justice has not yet announced any operation against the sites. Authorities also seized Almasirah, a Yemeni English-language news site, according to another seizure notice on that site, as well as kataibhezbollah.org, almaalomah.org, and kafmedia.net, news sites with alleged ties to Iran.

The FBI did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did the Department of Commerce.

The Associated Press reported that Iran blamed the U.S. government for the website seizures, but that U.S. officials did not acknowledge the move. </p>

                <h2>Wormable DarkRadiation Ransomware Targets Linux and Docker Instances #6</h2>
                <p>Cybersecurity researchers are sounding the alarm bell over a new ransomware strain called "DarkRadiation" that's implemented entirely in Bash and targets Linux and Docker cloud containers, while banking on messaging service Telegram for command-and-control (C2) communications.

                    "The ransomware is written in Bash script and targets Red Hat/CentOS and Debian Linux distributions," researchers from Trend Micro said in a report published last week. "The malware uses OpenSSL's AES algorithm with CBC mode to encrypt files in various directories. It also uses Telegram's API to send an infection status to the threat actor(s)."
                    
                    As of writing, there's no information available on the delivery methods or evidence that the ransomware has been deployed in real-world attacks.
                    
                    The findings come from an analysis of a collection of hacking tools hosted on the unidentified threat actor's infrastructure (IP address "185.141.25.168") in a directory called "api_attack." The toolset was first noticed by Twitter user @r3dbU7z on May 28.
                    
                    DarkRadiation's infection chain involves a multi-stage attack process and is noteworthy for its extensive reliance on Bash scripts to retrieve the malware and encrypt the files as well as Telegram API to communicate with the C2 server via hardcoded API keys. 
                    Said to be under active development, the ransomware leverages obfuscation tactics to scramble the Bash script using an open-source tool called "node-bash-obfuscate" to split the code into multiple chunks, followed by assigning a variable name to each segment and replacing the original script with variable references.

                    Upon execution, DarkRadiation checks if it's run as the root user, and if so, uses the elevated permissions to download and install Wget, cURL, and OpenSSL libraries, and takes a periodic snapshot of the users that are currently logged into a Unix computer system using the "who" command every five seconds, the results of which are then exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server using the Telegram API.
                    
                    "If any of these are not available on the infected device, the malware attempts to download the required tools using YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified), a python-based package manager widely adopted by popular Linux distros such as RedHat and CentOS," SentinelOne researchers explained in a parallel write-up of DarkRadiation published Monday.
                    
                    The ransomware, in its final phase of the infection, retrieves a list of all available users on the compromised system, overwrites existing user passwords with "megapassword," and deletes all shell users, but not before creating a new user with the username "ferrum" and password "MegPw0rD3" to proceed with the encryption process. Interestingly, SentinelOne's analysis reveals different variations wherein the password for the user "ferrum" is downloaded from the attacker's C2 server in few versions, while in others, it is hardcoded with strings such as "$MeGaPass123#," implying that the malware is undergoing rapid changes prior to actual deployment.

                    "It must be noted that the ransomware appends radioactive symbols ('.☢') as a file extension for an encrypted file," Trend Micro threat researcher Aliakbar Zahravi said.
                    
                    A second moving part associated with the attack is an SSH worm that's engineered to receive a credential configuration in the form of a base64-encoded parameter that's used to connect to the target system using the SSH protocol, and eventually download and execute the ransomware.
                    
                    In addition to reporting the execution status, along with the encryption key, back to the adversary's Telegram channel through the API, DarkRadiation also comes with capabilities to stop and disable all running Docker containers on the infected machine, after which a ransom note is displayed to the user.
                    
                    "Malware written in shell script languages allows attackers to be more versatile and to avoid some common detection methods," SentinelOne researchers said.
                    
                    "As scripts do not need to be recompiled, they can be iterated upon more rapidly. Moreover, since some security software relies on static file signatures, these can easily be evaded through rapid iteration and the use of simple obfuscator tools to generate completely different script files." </p>

                <h2>North Korea Exploited VPN Flaw to Hack South's Nuclear Research Institute #5</h2>
                <p>LSouth Korea's state-run Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) on Friday disclosed that its internal network was infiltrated by suspected attackers operating out of its northern counterpart.

                    The intrusion is said to have taken place on May 14 through a vulnerability in an unnamed virtual private network (VPN) vendor and involved a total of 13 IP addresses, one of which — "27.102.114[.]89" — has been previously linked to a state-sponsored threat actor dubbed Kimsuky.
                    
                    KAERI, established in 1959 and situated in the city of Daejeon, is a government-funded research institute that designs and develops nuclear technologies related to reactors, fuel rods, radiation fusion, and nuclear safety.
                    
                    Following the intrusion, the think tank said it took steps to block the attacker's IP addresses in question and applied necessary security patches to the vulnerable VPN solution. "Currently, the Atomic Energy Research Institute is investigating the subject of the hacking and the amount of damage," the entity said in a statement.
                    
                    The development comes following a report from SISA Journal, which disclosed the breach, alleging that the agency was attempting to cover up the hack by denying such an incident took place. KAERI attributed it to a "mistake in the response of the working-level staff." Active since 2012, Kimsuky (aka Velvet Chollima, Black Banshee, or Thallium) is a North Korean threat actor known for its cyber espionage campaigns targeting think tanks and nuclear power operators in South Korea.

                    Earlier this month, cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes disclosed a wave of attacks undertaken by the adversary to strike high-profile government officials in the country by installing an Android and Windows backdoor called AppleSeed for amassing valuable information.
                    
                    The targeted entities involved the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador of the Embassy of Sri Lanka to the State, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Nuclear Security Officer, and the Deputy Consul General at Korean Consulate General in Hong Kong, with the aforementioned IP address used for command-and-control (C2) communications.
                    
                    It is not immediately clear what VPN vulnerability was exploited to breach the network. But it's worth noting that unpatched VPN systems from Pulse Secure, SonicWall, Fortinet FortiOS, and Citrix have been subjected to attacks by multiple threat actors in recent years.</p>

                <h2>Cyber espionage by Chinese hackers in neighbouring nations is on the rise #4</h2>
                <p>A string of cyber espionage campaigns dating all the way back to 2014 and focused on gathering military intelligence from neighbouring countries have been linked to a Chinese military-intelligence apparatus.

                    In a wide-ranging report published by Massachusetts-headquartered Recorded Future this week, the cybersecurity firm's Insikt Group said it identified ties between a group it tracks as "RedFoxtrot" to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Unit 69010 operating out of Ürümqi, the capital of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in the country.
                    
                    Previously called the Lanzhou Military Region's Second Technical Reconnaissance Bureau, Unit 69010 is a military cover for a Technical Reconnaissance Bureau (TRB) within China's Strategic Support Force (SSF) Network Systems Department (NSD). The connection to PLA Unit 69010 stems from what the researchers said were "lax operational security measures" adopted by an unnamed suspected RedFoxtrot threat actor, whose online persona disclosed the physical address of the reconnaissance bureau and has had a history of affiliating with the PLA's former Communications Command Academy in Wuhan.

                    RedFoxtrot is noted to target government, defense, and telecommunications sectors across Central Asia, India, and Pakistan, with intrusions in the last six months directed against three Indian aerospace and defense contractors as well as major telecommunications providers and government agencies in Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, and Pakistan.
                    
                    "Activity over this period showed a particular focus on Indian targets, which occurred at a time of heightened border tensions between India and the People's Republic of China," the researchers said.
                    
                    Attacks staged by the adversary involved an assortment of open- and closed-source tools that have been shared across Chinese cyber espionage groups, including PlugX, Royal Road RTF weaponizer, QUICKHEAL, PCShare, IceFog, and Poison Ivy RAT.
                    
                    Also observed is the use of AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE infrastructure, which encompasses a modular Windows backdoor called ShadowPad that has been previously attributed to APT41 and subsequently shared between other Chinese state-backed actors. Furthermore, domains registered by RedFoxtrot — "inbsnl.ddns[.]info" and "adtl.mywire[.]org" — suggest that the threat actor may have set its sights on Indian telecom service provider Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and a Bengaluru-based company called Alpha Design Technologies Limited (ADTL) that specializes in research and development of missile, radar, and satellite systems.

                    The development comes more than three months after another China-linked threat group, dubbed RedEcho, was uncovered targeting India's power grid, including a power plant run by National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Limited and New Delhi-based Power System Operation Corporation Limited.</p>

                <h2>Russia bans VyprVPN, Opera VPN services for not complying with blacklist request #3</h2>
                <p>Russia's telecommunications and media regulator Roskomnadzor (RKN) on Thursday introduced restrictions on the operation of VyprVPN and Opera VPN services in the country.

                    "In accordance with the regulation on responding to threats to circumvent restrictions on access to child pornography, suicidal, pro-narcotic and other prohibited content, restrictions on the use of VPN services VyprVPN and Opera VPN will be introduced from June 17, 2021," the state agency said in a statement.
                    
                    The watchdog described them as threats in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 127 dated February 12, adding the restrictions will not affect Russian companies using VPN services in continuous technological processes. The development comes a little over a month after RKN sent a request to enterprises and organizations that use the two VPN services to inform the Center for Monitoring and Management of the Public Telecommunications Network and seek exceptions so as to avoid disruptions to their business operations.

                    The agency said more than 200 technological processes associated with 130 Russian companies are included in the "white lists."
                    
                    On March 28, 2019, the Russian government required VPNs, anonymizers, and search engine operators to ensure that they block sites included on Roskomnadzor's regularly updated register of banned sites through the Federal State Information System (FSIS).
                    
                    To that effect, ten providers of virtual private network (VPN) servers — including NordVPN, Hide My Ass (HMA), Hola VPN, OpenVPN, VyprVPN, ExpressVPN, TorGuard, IPVanish, Kaspersky Secure Connection, and VPN Unlimited — were mandated to connect to the national blocklist.
                    
                    According to Russian news agency Interfax, Kaspersky Lab was the only company that complied with the request. Avast, another cybersecurity vendor, exited the VPN market following the order.</p>

                <h2>Fugitive Anonymous Hacker ‘Commander X’ Arrested #2</h2>
                <p>Fugitive hacker Christopher Doyon, or Commander X, was captured in Mexico and has been extradited to the United States, where he will face decade-old hacking charges. Doyon was a member of the Anonymous hacktivist collective. 

                    According to an indictment, Doyon was part of a series of coordinated cyber attacks following a protest in Santa Cruz, California in 2010. Demonstrators occupied the front steps of the Santa Cruz Courthouses for approximately two months, from July 4 to October 2, 2010,  to protest the county’s law against camping that directly impacted people experiencing homelessness in the city. 
                    
                    Doyon later allegedly shut down the Santa Cruz County website in a DDoS, or distributed denial of service attack, in a coordinated effort with the People’s Liberation Front and Anonymous. According to the indictment, they flooded the network with external communications requests so “the target could not respond to legitimate traffic, or responded so slowly as to render the target effectively unavailable.” “In retribution for Santa Cruz City’s enforcement of [the anti-camping law], the PLF coordinated and executed a DDoS attack against Santa Cruz County’s computer servers,” the indictment said. “The PLF referred to these co-ordinated attacks on Santa Cruz County as ‘Operation Peace Camp 2010.’”

                    He is also being charged for conspiracy to commit intentional damage to a protected computer, committing intentional damage to a protected computer, and aiding and abetting. The documents also named Joshua John Covelli, or “Absolem” or “Toxic,” as a co-conspirator.
                    
                    In addition to hacking charges, Doyon is also facing charges for failing to appear in court. At the time, his counsel reported that he had fled to Canada. He continued to hack for years, according to a book he published about hacking while a fugitive.
                    
                    Doyon was a fugitive in Mexico for nearly a decade after working with the PLF and later on was a high ranking member in the hacktivist group Anonymous during their most active years.
                    
                    Doyon has spoken extensively about his time as a fugitive and the charges he faces. “No servers were breached, no data was stolen. It’s a small, crowdsourced act of civil disobedience,” he said in 2017. “It’s unjust to take that many years away from me for protest … from my perspective, I’m in political exile. But according to the U.S. Department of Justice, I’m a fugitive.”

                    A crowdfunding campaign set up by friends of Doyon earlier this month calls him a “political refugee.”
                    
                    “We are a group of Mexican citizens and friends of Commander X, who support him in his exile,” the crowdfunding campaign states. “We know it is difficult times for all of us, but he’s a political refugee and needs us all right now. We’d love to give back a little of what he’s given us all. We’ve provided housing for him and his two beautiful dogs. A nice, safe place with fields and mountains. Now we have to deal with medical and that's where you come in.”  </p>

                <h2>Credit Card Hacking Forum Gets Hacked, Exposing 300,000 Hackers’ Accounts #1</h2>
                <p>Carding Mafia, a forum for stealing and trading credit cards has been hacked, exposing almost 300,000 user accounts, according to data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned.

                    The data breach allegedly exposed the email addresses, IP addresses, usernames, and hashed passwords of 297,744 users. Have I Been Pwned announced the data breach on Tuesday, saying the breach happened last week. 
                    
                    On the Carding Mafia forum and its public Telegram channel, however, there was no sign that its users have been warned. Carding Mafia has more than 500,000 users, according to the forum's own statistics. The site administrator did not immediately respond to an email asking for comment. 
                    
                    Troy Hunt, the founder of Have I Been Pwned, told Motherboard that he was able to confirm the hacked database is legitimate. Hunt said that he noticed in the database that there were Mailinator email addresses, a service that allows anyone to create throwaway email addresses. Hunt said that he then inserted those addresses in the forum, using the Forgot Password feature, and he saw that those emails are recognized as valid emails. Usually Mailinator email addresses are created for one purpose and are not reused; the fact that these addresses are contained in the data dump and are also recognized by the forum suggests that the data is legitimate. Motherboard can confirm that the forum says "you have not entered an email address that we recognize" when trying to use the Forgot Password feature with an email that we have not used to register on the forum. 

                    "Another 'hacker hacking hackers' story," Hunt said.  
                    
                    Motherboard has not seen the data, and we are unable to independently confirm the breach. 
                    
                    On another hacking forum, a user was advertising the data allegedly stolen from Carding Mafia on January 27 of this year. This is the latest example of forums that cater to hackers or cybercriminals getting hacked. In 2017, hackers stole the database of a hacking forum called Darkode right after it opened. The infamous OGUSERS forum, where people traded stolen Instagram and other social media accounts, has been hacked twice, in 2019, and 2020. More recently, security journalist Brian Krebs reported that three of the most important Russian-language cybercrime forums have been hacked over the span of three weeks. 

                    In all of these cases, the hacked user information can be used to link pseudonymous users across different forums. Law enforcement agencies could also use the stolen data to try to identify criminals hiding behind those nicknames.</p>
